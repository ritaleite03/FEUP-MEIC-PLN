this is really about the reputation of the police i would love to be able to assume that the police would not set a dog on someone without good reason unfortunately that is not an assumption i am confident making i think it is very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge i think it is also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers probably most of them would happily look the other way while that happened i would expect this to be more likely if the guy had scorned the police officers involved because they are extremely protective of their own hurt feelings but that is another issue altogether i wish none of this was so it is a tragedy but police behaviour in the uk has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour the fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant it is the job of the courts to pass sentence not the police if they are shown to have acted properly so be it if not they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be and the fact that they are usually shown to be to all practical purposes immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem,0,12,10,0,6,0,5.493061443340548

as i understand it our courts have ruled the scheme illegal because of rwandas proven dodgy record on human rights the plan itself to send them to another country for processing is not actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this simply declaring rwanda officially safe is insane particularly as there are rwandan refugees fleeing from rwanda who have applied for asylum in the uk the home office will not talk about this but i suspect that the finances will not stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the uk taxpayer has financed those rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that cruella slaverman admired so much rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer s money and the national debt is about to hit trillion it was about trillion in when they took over if anyone is interested i am setting up a petition to deport the conservative party to rwanda it probably will not happen but it will give the civil service a laugh dear david k you are not done yet forward the email below to your potential supporters people need to click the link and confirm their support for us to check your petition once you have gained the required number of supporters we will check your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards if it does we will publish it we have a very large number of petitions to check at the moment so it may take us longer than usual to check your petition thank you for your patience once your petition has signatures it will not be able to add more until it is been checked by the petitions team so please wait until it is been checked and published before sharing it more widely thanks the petitions team uk government and parliament i have made a petition will you sign it click this link to sign the petition my petition deport the entire conservative party to rwanda send the conservative party to rwanda to enjoy their new life in the sun if this is not feasible i would settle for just the cabinet and parliamentary conservative party they are utterly useless,0,22,8,0,23,0,5.916202062607435

anthony carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning which has drawn criticism that he is either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament police minister anthony carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid the worsening police pay crisis in what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade victoria police remains locked in a bitter stalemate with the police association over a push to introduce nine hour shifts for frontline officers appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on tuesday mr carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government victoria police and the police association of victoria in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model which would also see officers work nine day fortnights providing it did not incur additional costs or require extra resources i do not think you will find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties being victoria police and the police association they are the parties to the deed an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator mr carbines said that process continues and while that process is under way it is not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere but the state government later confirmed mr carbines had indeed signed the deed on december last year a day after the police association announced a breakthrough mr carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by nationals mp danny o brien a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month s state budget mr o brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee s work because chief commissioner shane patton who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine hour shifts has claimed it would add bn to the force s annual wages bill he has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to police off the beat and undermine community safety a claim vehemently denied by the police union the impression i was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate mr carbines said the deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined shadow police minister brad battin slammed mr carbines who is also minister for racing when you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police of course he cannot explain his mistakes he said anthony carbines is either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament either way he is failing those he pretends to represent,0,16,25,0,6,0,6.214608098422191

let us be clear calling out actual racism is not divisive it is pointing out actual division classic conservative playbook approach to quash movements for equality however i feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns of course some people in australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics but for those that are not who are not also progressive it is just alienating labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism which i am going to is usually economic inequality people in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that eg if you are poor why does it make sense to vote yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough in this sense this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems you cannot let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem this is of course not the actual motivation of price who does not give a flying f about ordinary people when it actual comes down to it,0,11,13,0,9,0,5.420534999272286

you are quite wrong on all fronts which is consistent for your take on this matter but i will explain again genocide is a jus cogens offence as such the australian state cannot punish it it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that is it south africa in a bold move to distract anc critics at home when electoral woes were headed their way sought to make a case for it in the icj and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since our obligation under the convention is for the prevention though not the punishment some objective research would have illustrated why and i will have to explain it for you because of the pesky objective part the first jus cogens trial for which our own doc evatt was not involved but he was in ungar fun fact was the nuremberg trials here the new german government did not punish the old nor did the us take the lead a tribunal was convened with a panel of allied judges when the rwandan genocide went to trial it was at a un backed international tribunal similarly when the serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the yugoslav wars it was via a un international tribunal icty this is not coincidence it is a function of a jus cogens offence because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it in other words you can only have an international legal trial the right thing has happened the icj was involved australia s best bet is to let that play out and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators do not say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic lest someone take them seriously,0,9,20,1,9,0,5.7430031878094825

bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics in my opinion if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation we could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building if it was not an emergency years ago or even year ago it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling it is simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime events will still happen like the stabbing of people at bondi it is a tragedy but it does not represent an emergency i believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative i also do not understand how the high court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee jerk and compromised solution surely the high court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point is not the high court also bound to minimise harm or die on the hill of point of law,0,14,24,0,7,0,5.652489180268651

mining the way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning the one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for percent of your operating costs but it is available for existing facilities as well as new ones and it does not have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production super tax breaks they probably do not involve the same degree of economic costs they have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain which is fraying and so the big one the biggest hole is super tax breaks so they are costing billion a year it is about percent of gdp they will pretty soon cost more than the age pension they are obviously not very well targeted half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households i put these in two buckets there is the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it is not going to hurt you too much and that is title limits on pretax contributions it is raising the tax rate on some of those pre tax contributions through division tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool and if you do those there is or billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end and then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age you are not going to pay any tax on your earnings you basically had to check out of the tax system and that is costing australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year and that is not really sustainable in the long term ndis yeah look and look this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that is growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that is growing slower than the economy you know you know you have got something you have got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we are willing to pay at the outset of the ndis there was a really important you know piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to into employment and that is part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve they lean towards it being largely erroneous housing i think that is a great question and the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we have not built enough that is why housing in part is so expensive it is not the only factor but it is certainly a factor that we have some control over and if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy healthcare as the commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government and so you see you know we we have seen historically the commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care and leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals or in the case of the ndis you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state based settings and as the states have less money to spend they are going to be less cooperative in in in those conversations and i think this comes back to the fact that australian federation was not well designed on the tax side we have got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states downstream services sitting with states but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the commonwealth job seeker look it is a really tough one because i think it is clear that we need the rise so jobseeker for a long time has been well below the level that i think allows people to be empowered to go and find work as well as survive if they are on that payment for a while we have seen increases for originally from the coalition and then in labor last year that mean that the payments gone up by a week in real terms our position had always been it needed to rise by at least a week so we are still dollars a week away from that i could have imagined a world where we did more of that,0,39,14,0,40,0,6.71901315438526

i am in a strata as a renter and to be honest i am okay with it during the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard owners responsibility and also the external wall that the driveway is on strata responsibility and i am talking inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it my landlord owner decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they would not be fixing the wall to my courtyard that it was fine and likely would not happen again while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side this caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course mold checks one of the other issues i had was my courtyard is ft below the road level and i only had the one drain which was not effective to stop water pooling so that absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes i think that is what they called them were under the water so the water only had one way to drain into my apartment strata ripped away all the walls affected to redo the flashing including in the courtyard had more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue took the lovely workers days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it we had a very similar flooding incident this year strata were all over me to check the flashing was working there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just check via little holes they fixed the same week and look while it was unprecedented flooding it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to xs in mths end up inches under water and there was time between each event to fix it clearly as it was done in days total others can i guess be absolute shit shows but not all are edit to add ours is a corporate style strata no owners are on their board or whatever it is they are a management of the property style set up owners can bitch at them ask them to do repairs to common area but owners have to accept anything really they say unless totally unreasonable like the fight they had about cleaning the exterior with a pressure washing company owners did not want to strata told them we are doing it either comply and pick a company yourself or we will and you will be fined there mold growing lol,1,13,15,1,29,0,6.259581464064923
one of australia s most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value add this country has the world s third largest population of sheep behind china and india but much of the australian wool clothing we wear is imported such as men s suits from italy there are a multitude of similar examples why is it so difficult to add value here to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials the excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high we do not have the necessary skills our design and managerial systems capacities are limited or deficient among a host of others while there may be some elements of substance to these arguments it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development the coalition s usual response has been that such development should be left to the market however the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage the albanese government s future made in australia fmia strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility one important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy recognising that this country s transition to a cheaper clean energy future and possibly into a global energy superpower is the most significant industrial shift to come a key element of the fmia package so far is the national battery strategy launched last week of course the visionless destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power they claim renewables do not work when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow ignoring the potential for cost effective energy storage from these sources as minister for climate change and energy chris bowen points out this country learnt how to store water when it does not rain all the time so why not sun and wind power the battery strategy sets out a vision over the next decade in which australia becomes a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials providing secure and resilient battery supply chains delivering affordable and secure energy for australians boosting productivity and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition we certainly have the minerals in abundance in a strong resources sector as well as manufacturers know how sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce the government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments we just need to get on with it the global battery industry is dominated by china whose market share is estimated to be as high as per cent although there are other significant players such as japan s panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures i recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur elon musk who said he did not want his electric vehicle company tesla to be dependent on the chinese for batteries is there potential here to become a battery supplier to tesla the scope for a battery industry in australia is enormous a particular focus domestically is achieving grid scale and community storage beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals i have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite as australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite which would seem to be an advantage as natural graphite has superior heat storing capacity most of the graphite used globally is synthetic and mostly manufactured by the chinese using a dirty and energy intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke a residue of the oil refining industry to synthetic graphite i am also aware of an australian patented technology that uses a self contained chemical process with no wastage to refine natural graphite removing impurities such as iron and silica and further improving the storage capabilities miners can also market these byproducts providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential which should be released by the government s battery strategy an important related point is the potential of graphite based thermal storage has been largely ignored in australia as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and in part because of the fad like attraction of pumped hydro this technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of snowy the mother of all pumped hydro projects which as i pointed out in an earlier column did not stack up on a rigorous cost benefit analysis the potential advantages of graphite based thermal storage for grid scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels this would enable each house to draw electricity and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling even for cooking as required these homes might never again receive a power bill thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures which would be significant for industries such as processed food cement and even steel making there is an important distinction in grid scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load shifting batteries the hornsdale power reserve battery that musk built in south australia is an electric battery that really only provides short term back up to variations in power supply whereas a load shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks for example guaranteeing dispatchable or base load electricity the recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government s battery strategy specifically million for a battery breakthrough initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on high value battery products that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition there was a further million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise million to deliver an australian made battery precinct in partnership with the queensland government and billion for a future made in australia innovation fund that will support innovation commercialisation pilot and demonstration projects and early stage developments in priority sectors including development in battery technologies the implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination both domestically and internationally in australia state and local governments must collaborate along with the clean energy finance corporation cefc the australian renewable energy agency arena and private financiers these efforts may also need community action plans including for first nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments internationally it will be important to work and trade with both the united states and china efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the us s anti china strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with china where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money of course an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals the overarching need is to recognise these are national resources the mining of which should be to the benefit of all australians as easy as this is to say the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the rudd gillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry whatever happens this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward in summary the government s battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition,1,86,23,1,15,0,7.215239978730097

as a niche interest protest party the greens care little about the impact their hardline positions would have on ordinary australians the undergraduate and destructive stance taken by g reens leader adam bandt on the october terrorist attacks by hamas against israel is proof enough of the harm the far left party poses to australia s community cohesion the inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass anthony albanese but as outrageous as the anti israel stand is it is only part of a bigger threat that the greens represent to our national identity and good government when allowed to get close to the levers of power as they did in de facto coalition with the gillard labor government and with a balance of power position in the federal senate today the greens are exposed for the wreckers they are the albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the greens its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight good policy most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups has been put on ice to appease the greens changes to the nation s environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world something business supports labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the greens whatever one may think about the albanese government s corporate subsidy agenda the greens will only make it worse the greens have pledged to use their balance of power position to frustrate the government s wider agenda this includes housing where by focusing on renters the greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner city seats voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties for all the high ideals expressed before the last election the teals have failed to make an impression the greens once again have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions,0,18,24,0,2,0,5.945420608606575

tl dr get financial advice as soon as possible yesterday would be better centrelink are useless quality of care varies from day to day visit and be your mum s advocate i was the same as you and retired as well with hours on my hands each day both mum and dad went in together owning their home and with some cash investments it is a nightmare here are my pro tips if your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field they will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially it may be to sell the house it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc from memory it cost about they also offered an annual fee of or so to deal with all the centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year i knocked that bit back how hard can it be dumb decision at least for the first months centrelink have no idea i repeat they have no idea and just when you think you have it sorted you realise again that they have no idea you will need to spent hours on the phone waiting and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right because i had financial advice i knew what mum and dad should be paying of the full age pension plus a day each in means tested care fees it took me months of dealing with centrelink to get to that stage we are finally there i actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way but actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare i have just paid in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up and let us not forget the weeks where they charged dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit there is a significant difference between a deposit of and when it comes to fees aged care family visits are a must if staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum i can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner homes are short staffed overworked and subject to so much red tape that it is surprising that they function even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available ask around and find the good ones but realise even then that some times you will be disappointed in them be your mum s advocate that is the key word use it when you speak to management which you will i guarantee it is enshrined in the aged care charter of rights that said i have found most staff to be excellent pleasant and caring but they can only do so much if they are under resourced good luck it might not be an easy transition but it does get better,0,26,14,1,29,0,6.269096283706261

it is not difficult to understand nuclear power is expensive it might stack up against coal but it is absolutely hopeless compared to pv solar off shore wind is just absurd and the bowen should be accounted for his stupidity in wanting it power needs to be generated as close to the use as possible storage from pumped hydro and batteries is still cheaper than the alternative now an electric vehicle fleet would have enough storage capacity for over a day and we have never had that ability before ex american warships have mwh reactors and have a year lifespan after they are decommissioned dock one in newcastle or wherever we need some base load might be worth considering we use just under kw per capita per day that is it so solar panels rated at watts will produce more than the country needs they last years so install one solar panel per person every other year and we would have enough power so realistically with the taxes we pay no household should be paying for power it just one big con job thankfully i live off the grid and would not consider connecting to it it is just not worth the nonsense watching everyone power go off it is a joke the power should never go out companies are quoting enormous amounts for the ignorance of people i have kw batteries and kw of solar and it cost half what i have been quoted for half the capacity so where the money goes is anyone s guess it is just money no one is going to make it if we have cheap power we are paying times more than we should be if we had decent management,0,5,9,1,12,0,5.666426688112432

yes we pay on time not in full in a single payment in feb but with one of the instalment arrangements offered because feb is an expensive time of year for us with back to school costs family birthdays and hot on the heels of christmas and summer holidays once we get the rates notice we decide if we are going to pay quarterly or monthly and plan accordingly each council will have their own processes for any grace periods they choose to offer hardship arrangements and whether or not they will reduce or waive some interest would be on a case by case basis if you can prove hardship having a rates bill by definition means you have assets because you would not have this bill without having a house even if you are cash strapped though most councils publish these policies on their website or you can call and ask for a copy interest is legislated penalty interest rates act and last i looked was and if you get far enough behind on rates cycles they can and do start proceedings to force the sale of the house to recover the rates interest and legal fees,1,9,5,0,12,0,5.293304824724492

personal experience of never living in a city or a big town but near a tourist town but no one i know around here wants anymore people when tourist season comes the region becomes a nightmare impossible to move machinery between places cannot do the speed limit because tourists just stop in the middle of the road in a section and the price of land near town which is already high keeps getting pushed up because people want holiday homes if you try and build new cities there is a lot of factors to consider especially the impact on the existing community and the existing industry here it is almost all agriculture and mining you try and build a city then you impact both those industries which especially in the case of agriculture australia needs i think what should happen is the capital cities be built better expand upwards rather than outwards saves looking for places for new cities,0,4,2,1,5,0,5.075173815233827

nah we had migration in and the extra was just to offset our loss in migration the housing shortage has existed for over years outside of the cities x rental vacancy rates as well this problem was started by john howard in the s and balloned during the abbott turnbull morrison era that is why labor ran on housing reform in and yet australians did not believe the housing crisis existed until it hit the cities so now we are in a fucked position covid lnp money printing added to the problem too in the way of increasing interest rates i know it is both easy and lazy to blame migrants and that is what australians love but it is far better to be accurate and to live in truth,0,6,9,0,4,0,4.875197323201151
funny how leith van olsen just straight up says if you do not live in a detached house you are strictly worse off the current reality is yes you are worse off if you view strictly through the prism of how much can i flog my home for later if you value other aspects convenience lower price location not needing a backyard and etc then the equation changes but since a majority of the economy is tied into homes increase in price state govt gets most of its income in homes increase in price and most of the media literally has a stake in homes increase in price then you have the current reality strictly focusing on detached homes as the only options mean transport and services struggle to scale and serve the new areas this has been a known problem forever as well but at the end of the day it is hilarious listening to those that value freedom of choice and what not turning around and saying no the only shelter worth building is shelter that the market prices at around m median,0,12,8,1,8,0,5.225746673713202

in my opinion the best way to handle it if you are a business owner is to spread the additional cost of weekend labour out over the entire permanent menu so you do not have to charge a weekend surcharge and leave a bad taste in every customer s mouth every week especially when a large chunk of your business comes from weekend trade for public holidays these are less frequent and most people expect the surcharge on those days anyway so no big deal,0,2,3,1,4,0,4.454347296253507
the article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people direct democracy cannot fail to achieve the good of the majority although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason i was going to include compassion however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end it is part of the wisdom in do unto others as you would have others do unto you however direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out nothing is perfect but better is more useful than worse or the same therefore i encourage the people of australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of australia who are already paying for it basic facilities for every australian adult to contribute to the forum and reduced working hours to allow them to participate freedom of speech not freedom of action needs to be restored to the australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings speech has no meaning in itself only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action which is why it needs to be free even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver not the speaker the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech as for being hateful or hurtful to feelings feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out within each individual person outside of the control of a speaker whilst a speaker s intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda those emotions are created by the recipient for good or ill as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party we are not our brothers keeper it is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions with reason so that they do not take action that becomes the source of objective harm speech is not action or because of action that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech internally as well as externally,0,27,15,1,7,0,6.180016653652572

just going to do the major cities in alphabetical order here adelaide has suburban beaches all along its western side other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches which is mostly a good thing for swimming obviously surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south the climate is mediterranean hot dry summers mild cool wet winters and the ocean temperature is a little colder so access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter unless you are a hardcore minutes from a beach is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful it is also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish brisbane slightly limited access to beaches in brisbane itself there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the gold coast or sunshine coast which are separate cities brisbane itself has a kind of city beach thing on the brisbane riverfront area but it is not really much of a place to swim the climate is subtropical generally very warm and agreeable canberra inland city in the mountains with no ocean coastline and no beaches climate is generally quite cool very poor option for a beach lover but a lovely city otherwise darwin has beaches but you really cannot swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles this applies generally in the tropical north there is a sheltered waterfront area you can swim in that is very popular with locals and tourists alike they also have a wavepool there the climate is tropical easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long but yeah your options will be limited and in general you would be better off with access to a pool hobart has some beaches i assume but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of hobart life melbourne has beaches but like adelaide it is on a sheltered bay gulf so the surf is poor you can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches the climate is marine coastal some very warm and sunny days in summer but more erratic weather in other months it is probably more than fair to say that melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as sydney is although st kilda and brighton beach are quite popular perth like adelaide has suburban beaches all along its western side and like adelaide has a mediterranean climate unlike adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf they also are a bit narrower and rockier than adelaide beaches i think some may argue but realistically i think perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go weather surf ease of access although adelaide is very comparable close moreso than a lot of people think sydney has very highly rated beaches on its eastern side towards the pacific ocean but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways parking access crowds etc the surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach most people in sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere so being minutes from a beach is much less attainable than it might seem the weather is subtropical like brisbane but sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers you will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags that said it is hard to deny that sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact that is not without reason they are stunning and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture lifestyle in sydney so those are the capitals major cities adelaide perth and sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about you can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places here are some samples which i think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around perth tour of general suburban coastline sydney tour of several most popular beaches adelaide henley beach adelaide brighton beach adelaide grange beach adelaide glenelg beach adelaide glenelg beach adelaide semaphore beach adelaide aldinga beach adelaide christie s beach adelaide sellick s beach adelaide maslin beach i could not find a good general tour video but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety melbourne st kilda brighton gold coast surfer s paradise arguably one of the nation s best or best known beaches but a lot more than minutes away from brisbane gold coast is its own distinct city but much smaller than brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot all those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments darwin waterfront very limited area you can actually swim but it is literally almost always c hobart nutgrove beach realistically quite often too cold to swim afaik but very beautiful however you might want to consider some smaller regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within minutes of the beach i will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state nsw byron bay coffs harbour wollongong newcastle qld gold coast sunshine coast noosa mackay airlie beach bundaberg yeppoon sa ceduna port lincoln moonta wallaroo port elliot victor harbor robe emu bay tas bicheno coles bay vic apollo bay torquay lorne warrnambool sorrento bell s beach geelong sale wa margaret river bunbury albany broome esperance shark bay there are many others

i would encourage everyone to read the aat decisions in question before they leap to any conclusions in the xrgy decision for example the human trafficking allegations were given serious consideration but the allegation came from asio and the afp declined to prosecute him for the crime from in the absence of a criminal conviction the decision maker should rarely find that the conduct which would constitute an offence has occurred the task of asio is a different task to that of adducing criminal guilt it is the afp that is best placed to investigate charge and refer to the director of public prosecutions cases of people smuggling in the applicant s case it has not done so if the tribunal were to prefer or put more weight on the asio material than the afp material such an approach would raise constitutional separation of power issues given the above it was not really possible for the aat to treat the allegations any other way this is trial by media essentially i have not looked for the saki decision but the minister s comments may well be accurate that the aat did not properly consider the likelihood of reoffending easy to say in retrospect of course but even so it is not evidence that the direction is a problem just its application i know dutton and possibly others here think we should be able to apply extra judicial punishment to non citizens serve your time and then piss off home untested allegation too bad get out but not only is this a textbook authoritarian approach and not only does it compromise our international obligations including those against non refoulement discussion here there is also the fact that the international community could start doing it to us deporting all their hardened criminals to our shores for us to deal with it is a trick that ultimately goes against the interests of the australian community even if it is emotionally satisfying,0,7,14,0,9,0,5.796057750765372

lcd backlights have an expected lifespan typically measured in hours it can be a pretty wide range of hours from hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components screen brightness other settings environment it was being used in so on and so forth some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans with lots of caveats how many hours per day did you use the monitor what brightness level was the room it was in hot or humid did it get direct sunlight etc etc etc multiply the amount of hours you used it by years take off a bunch for whatever conditions and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor then you can argue per australin consumer law that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it is not meeting the expected lifespan but if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor you are going to have a much harder time arguing that point,1,4,2,0,8,0,5.176149732573829
why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it is a fake the ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people are not usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image which is the part that ties it to being porn is questionable it is like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations really i do not understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent the prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you cannot trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis the purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that even if deepfake porn is produced it is likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics so once again i am unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes it is easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge the issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical objective harms themself must be triaged because we do not have enough resources to manage them completely let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today particularly fear and paranoia yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear how can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it the ends do not justify the means,0,18,39,1,15,0,6.163314804034641

i cannot really find any transcript of tingle s speech in which the context of the racist quote was made so it is very difficult to judge the intent and meaning behind the comment the only bit i can find we are a racist country let us face it we always have been and it is very depressing there is no metric on what qualifies as a racist country or not but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation the treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre the fact the first federal parliament passed the white australia policy a blatantly racist law which remained in law for years the majority of australia s existence up until this time the practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation s existence again up until the s fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today different legislation for those living in indigenous communities like nt alcohol laws on a non political level as her comment did not specifically mention politics only the vast vast majority of commercial tv and media featuring white faces today out of australians are of asian heritage there is more australians of asian heritage than americans of black or latino heritage but you would not know it from watching australian tv the national character and story being almost exclusively from a white anglo saxon perspective with only fleeting mentions of a vague multiculturalism news media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite news media egging on race riots like cronulla tingle is right racism is a big part of the australian story australia may not be as racist as other nations and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments besides beyond the sky news and lnp outrage brigade who deities the abc even though the comments were made outside her employment so there is no breach of charter who else is criticising her no one,0,5,18,1,8,0,5.8944028342648505

nsw liberal mp julian leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the greens making the unilateral recognition of a palestinian state and the weakening of the western alliance a price of government on wednesday morning labor and the coalition teamed up to oppose a greens motion in the house of representatives recognising the state of palestine with mr leeser telling the australian after the vote that labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party it is time labor stopped preferencing the greens on their ballot paper he said mr leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a labor greens coalition it is bad enough that labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally israel to placate the corbynites from attacking aukus mr leeser told the australian but how much worse would it be if labor allowed the greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government this is not an environmental party he said this is party that is obsessed with israel and jews what is adam bandt advocating for labor mp questions greens leader s announcement only five people supported the greens motion including the four lower house greens mps and tasmanian independent andrew wilkie while mps voted against it speaking in support of his own motion in the house of representatives mr bandt said that recognition of palestine was long overdue and was not just a symbolic move it is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of gaza he said it is a concrete step towards peace as the prime minister of norway said last week there cannot be peace in the middle east if there is no recognition mr bandt said the scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping people a health system has been destroyed there are mass graves in hospitals aid has been blocked children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink he warned that a human engineered famine was now taking its toll on the civilian population in gaza that amounts to collective punishment of these people mr bandt said that labor s credibility was also on the line declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you recognise just one side labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of palestine he said labor has stood with the extreme israeli government of benjamin netanyahu josh frydenberg slams the greens for promoting un australian values assistant foreign minister tim watts took aim at mr bandt for the motion arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer mr watts said simplistic wedge motions in the house do nothing to advance the because of peace he said wedge politics only divides the community he said anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution but the greens are not serious they prefer slogans to policy a two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other on the question of recognition we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the because for peace like many countries australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard he said australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process it could occur as part of a peace process but mr watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms noting that hamas was a terrorist organisation we see no role for them in this he said a palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten israel s security we want to see a reformed palestinian governing authority we want to see a commitment to peace and how the palestinian authority leads its people mr leeser who spoke against the motion told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded end the occupation greens leader calls for labor to take action against israel this motion sends the message that hamas violent terrorist attacks its murders its abductions its gang rapes and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable he said this motion means recognising a palestinian state when hamas refuses to release more than israeli hostages he also took aim at the greens saying that it was a party that promoted women s rights and those of the lgbti community but which was also advancing the because of organisations like hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women and lgbti people in the world mr leeser who describes himself as a proud and public jewish mp also said that anti semitism had become a central plank of green philosophy the greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the october terrorist attacks that passed this house on october even before israel had begun its operations in gaza he said they refused to condemn greens mp jenny leong for her comments that said jews have tentacles and that jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country mr leeser also noted that mr bandt when directly asked on the abc s insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a jewish homeland state would not answer reflecting on the greens motion executive council of australian jewry co chief executive alex ryvchin said the minor party had exposed how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last,0,41,46,1,9,0,6.913737350659685

put every possible solution on the table do not legislate things away because you cannot see past your ideology we have not legislated away the ability to put nuclear in front of the australian people but no one wants to seem to do it the biggest nuclear advocates in australia are currently refusing to reveal their costings or where they think these power plants would be built or who would build them or when it could be done the legislation does not prevent nuclear from being put on the table the cluster fuck that is nuclear costings and build times is what is preventing nuclear from being put on the table the actual reality of nuclear is why the advocates are not putting the details on the table and that is why people talk about it as an excuse to not do anything about climate change because it is loudest advocates do not actually seem interested in it and because this detail less wailing just seems to further drag out the debate without adding an actual option,0,4,4,1,3,0,5.181783550292085

a private consulting firm handed almost million in aged care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money delivered a page final report and issued legal threats the saga of miles morgan australia s involvement in the future fit turnaround project for meals on wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem it is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor general rona mellor miles morgan australia mma is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of western australia from by barbara macnish a signatory to the first two contracts under the future fit program alongside her then chief executive officer lakshman gunaratnam a former deloitte australia partner macnish sold the business to gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in december and he took control as sole director four days before christmas that year together with former labor adviser loire hunter gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle leveraged pty ltd miles morgan australia s involvement with meals on wheels began in may when the morrison government announced changes to the commonwealth home support program that would eventually combine lower level care with more intensive care in a new category called the support at home program meals on wheels australia was approached by mma with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of meals on wheels providers meals on wheels australia had asked the department of health and aged care for million the government approved but without the knowledge of meals on wheels australia the department recommended to then aged care services minister richard colbeck that it should give the money directly to mma because it had already been working with the meals network had a deep understanding of the needs and a strong working relationship with the department this puts mma in a unique position to deliver on the department s requirements the submission prepared for colbeck says this procurement was through a direct approach one supplier of mma under an existing panel arrangement despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by greens senator janet rice the contract notice for the million first phase of mma work still states the process was conducted as an open tender that contract was later revised up to more than million the saturday paper is not suggesting that mma or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract within months of winning the contract mma decided meals on wheels australia did not have the capability for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined instead some state associations were chosen to participate,0,17,5,0,0,0,6.2285110035911835

the attorney general jaclyn symes said the reform would protect any victorian who made a report to police granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed regardless if they are actually innocent as we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them once in the justice system mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty until recently innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action but this new legislation appears to block that avenue meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations i acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation which may also be false in advance of a judgement of guilt the proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations in our system of justice the costs of making allegations is borne by the state however the cost of defense including defending their reputation against allegations is usually borne by the defendant part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation without that option the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt based merely on allegation even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict whilst i understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations this is not prescribed justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused regardless of the outcome of the court crimes need to be objective harms of import because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only regardless of their guilt which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence to also punish people regardless of their guilt as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous however many crimes are just that based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms i urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement i think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage we have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence if a crime is of sufficient import and true then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward then we need to address why that is not develop knee jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings this perception that victim survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits if an allegation is truthful why would a defamation action succeed making a threat is pointless and has no power if it cannot be carried out that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia however i recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and i believe it needs to be re evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice,0,48,55,1,12,0,6.52649485957079

the australian federal police union is threatening strike action to shut down airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the albanese government over pay and conditions afp association president alex caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether afp officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting saying members were sick of being disrespected by government we are considering walking out at airports walking out at parliament house walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the afp that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal he told the australian denouncing the government s latest pay offer of per cent mr caruana said he had spoken to about afpa members in recent days and it is very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action essentially it would be that airports might have to shut down parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements he said identifying the australian nuclear science and technology organisation and the holsworthy barracks as other potential locations for industrial action it is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the afp and they want a fair pay deal they do not want to be the lowest paid police force in australia the afpa is urging members to vote no to the afp pay offer which includes increases to allowances on top of per cent in wage rises over three years if the offer is rejected mr caruana said the union would examine applying to the fair work commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action it is difficult for the afp to do any strike action or withholding of labour action because of the implications to national security he said what i can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space we would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports and we were to withdraw labour from places like parliament house from places like antso and a few other places like holsworthy etc we are not actually putting the community at risk if the airports continue to operate the airports are then taking on that risk if parliament chooses to sit the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the afp act that would be in breach of national security and a step too far we will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the afp that they need to offer a fair wage deal for afp members,0,24,26,1,14,0,6.194405391104672

paywall the nsw coalition s most senior law officer alister henskens has been accused of displaying a dereliction of duty after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill in an extraordinary move henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the minns government s new laws which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders would pass without consultation the changes follow a string of high profile alleged domestic violence offences including the death of forbes woman molly ticehurst last month shadow attorney general alister henskens said the coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by thursday shadow attorney general alister henskens said the coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by thursday credit louise kennerley the bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when henskens the shadow attorney general argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws he later said he had seen the government s press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the coalition and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support labor s laws however henskens push failed when sydney mp alex greenwich and greens mp for newtown jenny leong delivered a blistering attack greenwich said he had been in parliament for five premiers five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments and he had never seen a proposal with such disrespect to stakeholders in this space i have never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you do not want to consult with them greenwich said they want to rubber stamp something they have not ever seen but let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space the crossbench will pick it up leong said the former coalition government had years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures such as shelters for women fleeing partners she said henskens attempts to ram through the bill smacked of relevance deprivation leader of the house ron hoenig said it was completely reckless of the coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said the bill could be to abolish the liberal party hoenig said attorney general michael daley told parliament that the nsw police force had requested time to ensure that all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state domestic violence support groups including say no to violence had also asked that the new laws be considered properly before being passed on tuesday the minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community at the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault strangulation kidnapping or coercive control there will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender s release in the supreme court a requirement for magistrates and judges to consider red flag behaviour such as animal cruelty stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families,0,17,42,1,3,0,6.416732282512326

as others have suggested i would schedule a meeting on a day i was already working and potentially do it during work hours or before after the shift if required by all means have a support person there too i personally would not expect to be paid extra for this sort of meeting especially after not notifying woolies at an appropriate time about being sick due to sleeping in and i certainly would not be looking for clauses in an eba to justify a minute meeting and looking to be paid hours minimum for it contacting fair work too if you spent this time being productive who knows what you could achieve unbelievable sounds very entitled and painful to be honest if i were the manager and faced with these expectations i would probably give shifts to the more organised and less demanding staff the last thing i would do in your position is rock the boat if i wanted to keep my job if i were your colleague i would be furious that you want to get paid hours extra for a meeting that would never had occurred in the first place had you done the right thing and that i have to pick up the slack too i am sure in the eba it is a requirement to call in sick at a certain time you cannot pick and choose which parts you agree with grow up,0,10,5,0,21,0,5.480638923341991

a couple friends work in hospitality and i have to agree with the sentiment that casual workers seem easily exploited but when did you get here it was not always an employer s market pre covid at least in hospitality casual workers could leave bad work environments because they had a lot more options post covid there are fewer customers rosters are thin and venues closing down means workers are competing for fewer jobs and they stick around even when mistreated a lot of casual work is taken up by visa holders like yourself who do not have a safety net and tend to be even more exploitable so i am not sure it is australian workers who are tolerant i think the real question is why are exploitative employers hard to hold accountable there is fair work but they seem to only go after big corporations in victoria tasmania and queensland there is jobwatch but they have had funding massively cut last year maybe you are asking why australians do not care enough to fund organizations that support casual workers rights that is fair to call out,0,15,5,0,5,0,5.241747015059643

i am surprised but honestly the alp have done a bad job in terms of playing politics the population for years has been saying to do something about immigration cost of living they have not gotten on the front foot and shown they are doing something a bit like scomos fire blunder cost of living was a major issue and he had the voice that died down and he stopped tradies from coming and ramped up immigration they had a big argument over some minor changes to taxes that everyone wanted indexed anyway he was given benefit of the doubt and now he has come out with a inflationary budget people are saying when is he going to do something about cost of living i am not saying he does not care or he is not doing anything i am talking about the spin he needs to recover the frame that he is the one to be voted in to handle cost of living that is always going to be a little tough for the alp due to peoples perception as the lnp being better at managing the books but him leaving it for so long has not given people confidence he is running out of time because now anything that takes more than a year like essential infrastructure to improve housing supply is too late now he is done with another budget so he only has the one just before the election left which is too late dutton has come out with a major decrease to immigration which a lot of the public perceive as being a silver bullet to cost of living i do not personally agree that has really put albo on the back foot as i said with no budget until just before the next election he does not have much of a chance to reset the publics perception the media will keep piling on with the landlord private jet out of touch stuff and dutton will keep quiet qld a major swing state also has a crime problem and an ex police qlder will probably do well i still think albo can win a majority but he needs something big to turn it around like a bushfire refugee boats covid that can be used politically to readjust perceptions otherwise its going to be a coalition with greens teal or a slight liberal victory,0,15,10,1,6,0,5.988961416889864

the nsw government is withholding more than half a billion dollars a year in waste levies collected from local councils a nsw parliamentary committee has heard the levy is also costing the state government money because it is incentivising northern nsw councils to send their landfill across the border to queensland according to evidence presented to a nsw standing committee investigating the sustainability of local government the united services union says instead of the levy being used to help councils manage waste more sustainably it is being hoarded in state government coffers the union says the government collects around million a year in waste levies from councils but only invests million of that back into waste management initiatives and pockets the rest the nsw government is withholding money collected from local councils and their communities to the tune of million a year through the waste levy general secretary graeme kelly said ahead of his appearance before the committee on friday nsw losing out to queensland the usu says the levy collected would be significantly more if funds collected by the state government were reinvested into new local and regional landfill sites particularly in northern nsw where most councils are now sending landfill waste over the border to queensland waste being transported to queensland is at a cost to ratepayers and results in no waste levy being collected in some regions mr kelly says the waste levy is supposed to be an environmental measure but it is become a perverse incentive for some councils to dodge the levy by dumping waste in queensland most of the councils on the north coast from coffs harbour to the tweed border use contractors who are technically robbing nsw councils and taxpayers by not paying the levy broader financial crisis the usu argues the waste levy is just one symptom of the broader financial crisis facing local government in nsw and is also calling for an end to rate pegging echoing concerns raised by local government professionals nsw the usu wants to see the rate peg abolished as part of a broader reform package to secure the long term financial sustainability of the local government sector scrapping rate pegging will not solve all the problems facing councils overnight but it is an essential first step mr kelly said the united services union represented workers in local government and represents every town and community in the state and every job within local government up to and including general manager,0,6,19,1,0,0,6.025865973825314

rebecca huntley assesses the public mood for a living right now she says it is grim and the housing crisis is at the root of it you actually cannot have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that does not begin and end with housing there is a deep almost intractable despair says huntley director at the strategic communications consultancy degrees east the way people in her focus groups see it she says it does not matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down or unemployment is up or unemployment is down does not matter if it is a pandemic not a pandemic gfc or not a gfc housing is a horror show to an ever increasing extent they see just one solution to their woes cut immigration they are like we cannot get ourselves out of this mess therefore we just need less people lining up for the rental property less people trying to buy the house just less people says huntley it is not such a new sentiment though perhaps not previously so keenly felt opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake one poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration pauline hanson reeled off the results of of these polls conducted over the past six years in a speech to parliament in march of course hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in famously warning in her first speech that australia was being swamped by asians two decades later after having lost her seat in the lower house she made a triumphant return as a senator for queensland in warning australia was being swamped by muslims in her march speech though hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing transport health education and other services in reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters she claimed vindication the major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were out of control was i right she asked her fellow senators you would never admit it but yes i was she said it is hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long the large majority of people want it cut the great majority of the political media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns it has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is a good thing enriching the nation culturally and economically questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of australia s immigration intake ian lowe emeritus professor in the school of environment and science at griffith university can attest to that lowe was president of the country s pre eminent environmental organisation the australian conservation foundation for years until during that time he tells the saturday paper he advocated for the acf to prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure the organisation was reluctant to take a position however on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be taken as a sort of pauline hanson type racist comment cutting migration will make housing cheaper but it would also make us poorer the boost to government budgets is enormous so the acf avoided the issue and it still does today as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues meanwhile australia s population is on track to grow to about million people an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of sydney melbourne and brisbane by,0,28,31,0,7,0,6.489204931325317

he claimed that by rebalancing the migration program the coalition would free up almost additional homes in the first year and well over homes in the next five years how this number was calculated he did not say it appeared all the more dubious given his fordham interview suggested dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts there is in any case reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home during the covid lockdowns when australia s borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero prices continued to rise rapidly according to modelling from the grattan institute high migration does have some effect on housing costs for every above the long term average rents rise about per cent thus last year by this estimate australia s record number of migrants probably pushed them up about per cent but says trent wiltshire grattan s deputy director of migration and labour markets asking rents have been rising per cent a year so it is a factor but certainly not the driving factor migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs based on the rather sketchy information provided by dutton says wiltshire it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around over the next four years compared to the existing skilled migration intake such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be billion with all due respect to grattan it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of dutton s proposed cuts would be because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall what is clear is that for more than a year dutton and other members of the coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to australia and blaming the labor government for the influx this is simply not true policy experts say in fact the explosion in nom was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous coalition government in response to the pandemic in the budget the last before the pandemic nom was forecast to be about a little above the long term average instead because of covid it plunged close to zero for two years when the borders reopened the morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers and particularly overseas students to return in the coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost numbers says abul rizvi a former deputy secretary of the department of immigration policies such as unlimited work rights for students fee free student and working holiday maker applications and a special covid visa the message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences so it did not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality it was like an unregulated gold rush says rizvi the changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the coalition government s shabby treatment of overseas students when covid hit says phil honeywood chief executive of the international education association of australia in contrast with countries such as britain and canada which provided support for overseas students to stay scott morrison told students to just go home says honeywood that caused incredible damage to australia s reputation as a safe welcoming study destination country,0,23,9,1,0,0,6.408528791059498

when the defamatory allegation is that the defamed person has committed some crime it is a difficult issue because the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt is so much higher than the civil standard of balance of probabilities both sides of an issue will leverage that difference as has happened in the lehrman case his supporters were insistent that he was not found guilty so you cannot call him a rapist and his detractors were insistent that the criminal case was wrongly decided and that obviously common sense balance of probabilities and the reasonable young liberal with the sloshed hottie test meant that he probably did rape her a position the defamation trial judge agreed with truth is always a very hard problem for the law to deal with and our adversarial system makes it even harder we tend to substitute consensus and or the side of the argument that the jury or judge like better,0,6,12,0,3,0,5.056245805348308

having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war cah war crimes and being told by very very online people how i was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with g which the icc neglected to indict upon suggesting jews i mean akshully zionists do control the world i am really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a bachelor s in tiktokpolisci from reddit university conceptually the idea that no state s leaders can be immune to prosecution from jus cogens offences is one that even in spite of the views of some states like china and the us holds water we have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law which in lay speak means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal the sovereign state cannot make it legal which is the main reason why america struggles with the concept because of their own take on constitutional jurisprudence the icc sought in a sense to manage this by targeting individuals the icj focuses on disputes between states because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the us views and makes use of the different types of jurisdiction in international law so we are getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory in practice the us also raised the prospect of misuse of the court s authority on political grounds where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance not justice the way the icc handled this does give that complaint some credit for one in trying to give an appearance of balance prosecutor khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state as flawed as those leaders are it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered entirely to politics in doing so the calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of mohammed deif and yayha sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement the icc s investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of israel as part of their investigations it was arranged and never followed through on under the icc charter if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence then the icc will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over it is of course doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe israel would self investigate on these grounds but a court like this must be strict in its observing of protocol if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense the us russia and china all already are in opposition to the concept which is of the permanent members of the un security council international cooperation has died for less see also league of nations and us non involvement this brings us to australia the opt out clause dutton refers to exists for the us and this situation though it is hard to see bibi coming here it should exist dutton on a diplomatic front is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it but there is a wider argument which dutton is missing and that is not the first time i have had to say this about the loto israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis it is right to view october as unacceptable it is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting hamas talking points and confidently saying they are too smart for propaganda as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical islamic views of jewish people it is not right however to carry out collective punishment under international law australia s correct path has been trodden by the albanese government despite unhelpful performative and stupid opposition from the liberals and greens alike reaffirm ally status with israel ask israel to observe its international obligations at law hold it to account as we would any liberal democracy that falls short of the standards whilst also worshipping at the altar of moynihan s law as our left so ably does but also suggest that where the icc is concerned the legal case is valid and that australia will only ever consider extraditing after mohammed deif yiyha sinwar and mohammed al masri have been locked up in den haag there is less pressure on qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over these cowards who make america s koch brothers look lovely and secular that has to change and if israeli leaders are tried where hamas leaders are not it makes a mockery of the whole system saying as such should be without controversy so like many things dutton is a little bit right but it is purely by accident he does not know why or how and it is grossly offset by how wrong he is too,0,28,41,1,17,0,6.815639990074331

i drink espresso so do not really have the issue with milk but curious as to why soy or almond milk incurs a higher charge for the most part soy milk is non perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities perhaps at a discount and stored because it has a longer shelf life i just did a quick scan and the alternative dairy co barista soy milk which claims it is uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance and has consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art costs for x litre cartons so per litre a litre of full cream dairy farmers milk costs around and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away does not it make sense to then encourage people to choose soy or almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and is not throwing away stock perhaps i am over simplifying it but it seems obvious that if an inner city cafe became known for selling soy almond or oat milk lattes for less than dairy milk lattes it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing i do not know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost i will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me i do not know what i am talking about a i do not know what i am talking about and b i have a machine at home i load in the beans that i like i push a button it grinds them and espresso comes out that is as complicated as my coffee existence gets so i am definitely not a customer of yours and i do not really care what the cost of a coffee is i am simply asking why soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes i get that many moons ago soy or almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that is hardly the case now,0,11,5,0,20,0,6.082218910376446

it is a western global problem because most western nationals have took a very similar fiscal approach since the early but more importantly after the gfc trillions was spent for the gfc and to stop a total collapse of the system that money needed to be paid back and the quickest and easiest way was to rapidly increase the tax base via immigration same with covid it is literally by design problem is it takes decades to build up the infrastructure training teachers and support etc to accommodate such levels of immigration not to mention successful multiculturalism does not really work if immigration happens at such levels so quick australia used to take the right approach in the early s but we are quickly heading into the same direction as europe and you only have to look at r europe to see how many such levels of immigration is having on there standards of living on there culture aka it is degrading rapidly,0,5,5,0,2,0,5.099866427824199

the whole point of being a casual that you are not required to give notice or request time off you have the availability to work or you do not and the only control the employer has over that is that they can refuse to offer you work they have flagged that they will not be offering you hours on your return so that is good to know so you line up a new job for your return but i would be ignoring the request to resign they do not need it and do not deserve the civilities it is so frustrating to see employers get in a snit about casuals behaving like casuals if they want loyalty and reliability then they should employ staff part time them not being able to control your pattern of work beyond the current roster is a them problem do not solve a problem that a is not actually a problem and b is a consequence of them not employing a stable workforce,0,7,7,0,10,0,5.1298987149230735

i feel like i am done with this industry yeah every single person i know who has ever been a chef reached that point it is just a shitty job the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time working when you should be on a break a well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run you could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find you could create a good kitchen but honestly if you are burned out and over it then that is probably not the best option a good manager is passionate about the job and you probably cannot do that anymore maybe in a few years you might be able to if you can finish your cert easily then absolutely do that the piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job maybe the one after that it is worth having you could honestly do almost anything a good mate of mine became a school teacher they tried to get him to teach kids to cook but he told them to fuck off literally dropped an f bomb in that meeting he teaches maths and science does not have any particular aptitude for either subject but he can read a high school textbook and that is all you really need plus a relevant degree in teaching obviously he had to spend four years in university to get that worked in a kitchen part time while studying or you could do what another mate did and move laterally he is a hotel manager now the hotel has a kitchen obviously and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job but does not actually work in the kitchen ultimately put your mental health first and get out of the situation you are in you do not have to do it instantly just start moving in that direction you will feel so much better once you have taken the first step trust me i am in the middle of a similar transition myself different industry though still working the job i do not like but i will not be much longer and that is made a huge difference,0,23,5,0,27,0,5.971261839790462

just make the tobacco the same price as in europe by putting such high tax in australia on tobacco they have created the illegal trade the high price means that smokers will buy illegal tobacco and so hence it creates the market for illegal it is the same as perfume or designer handbags they are markup criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk i like the new zealand approach the government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers the price of the tobacco is reasonable and so there is no market for the criminal gangs to make a profit with illegally important tobacco both schemes achieve the same thing the australian approach is really quite dumb compared to the new zealand approach,0,6,9,1,1,0,5.056245805348308

prime minister anthony albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the autonomous administration of north and east syria two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told the saturday paper that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so called isis brides and their children the prime minister had made it very clear that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps the issue would not be revisited before the election not bringing these women and children who are australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will says save the children australia chief executive mat tinkler that and nothing else most of the people are detained in al roj camp near the turkish border and have been interviewed in person by australian security officials four people detained in al hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to australian officials save the children australia is currently attempting to compel the australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in syria via a writ of habeas corpus in november last year federal court justice mark moshinsky dismissed save the children s application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the commonwealth last week the full bench of the federal court heard an appeal from save the children to overturn justice moshinsky s ruling australian citizenship has to mean something says tinkler being a child has to mean something too and if our government cannot move to help a group of australian women and their children from one of the worst places on earth then what does it actually mean to be an australian citizen in a supporting affidavit to the federal court greg barton professor of global islamic politics at deakin university said the australian government faced no practical barrier from the autonomous administration of north and east syria aanes or from current circumstances on the ground to repatriate australian women and children aanes together with the united states desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated there are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused barton said in then liberal prime minister scott morrison authorised the repatriation of eight australian children from a syrian detention camp many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that had it not been for the covid pandemic morrison would have repatriated all the australian women and children in october labor s home affairs minister clare o neil announced a group of four australian women and their australian children had been repatriated from al roj camp to their families in new south wales mostly in western sydney last week one of those women mariam raad pleaded guilty to willingly entering a syrian region controlled by islamic state a terrorist organisation raad who is on bail will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to years in prison she is the only person among the people repatriated in october to face court kamalle dabboussy chief executive of the australian federation of islamic councils afic says the who were repatriated in october have comfortably settled back into their home communities in sydney he led a public campaign for his daughter mariam dabboussy s return to australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north east syria it was not a headache i can take a panadol for that it was a fucking migraine a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister s office and the pain of it has not gone away they are getting on with their lives getting engaged with their communities playing sports and as far as national security goes they are doing exactly what they said they would do which is cooperate with australian authorities says dabboussy,0,17,19,1,2,0,6.520621127558696

it should need funding ironically the only people who receive funding or care are those that have developed extreme forms of illness such as psychosis or those that have already broken the law and are now on some kind of order to be treated as a result through the courts if you go to a hospital beforehand seeking help you will be turned around and be told to use the privatised system want to see an actual psychologist long term for a clinical condition indefinitely once you hit your sessions you pay entirely out of your own pocket it is a dimly lit road it creates its own chaos and then ironically even where the chain of causality is unbroken and the government is responsible for its own mess when a man stabs over people while there are laws to punish the doctors involved with medical negligence at a criminal level leading to a manslaughter charge the knives are turned on the community as a whole instead ironically the entirety of queensland health was aware who that person was hence the causality what i have learned is that the government is great at knee jerk reactions and coming up with bad responses as a result but to be proactive or even retroactive and to deal with the problem from where it stems from in the lack of interest in providing clinical care or prosecuting those that allow for these lapses that is a nigh on impossibility even when the cases and reasons for action are plonked directly in the face of governments that continue the harm i do not have all the answers but i have one and it would start by holding the director of queensland health to account for the negligent homicide of innocent people in sydney last month and rooting out every bad practitioner that refuses to treat maybe that is a tough road but at this point its what it deserves those types of actions are beginning in the united states through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of tony timpa but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding on that note not having enough funding never means blame the patient but clinicians attempt to assert that repeatedly nevertheless blame the patient for turning up with a mental health complaint or outsource it to some third party that may or may not give a fuck,0,16,20,0,9,0,6.073044534100405

not really the gist of michael west s article is what is known as the doctrine of command responsibility it comes about when senior leaders did not order war crimes but they knew or should have known and stopped them this applies to military leaders of course which is what mcbride was upset about but it applies to political leaders too since ultimately in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership just think of it this way let us imagine that our intervention in afghanistan had been a stunning success let us say that today because of australia s intervention the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit of course so if you are to take the credit when things go well under your leadership you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly that is the doctrine of command responsibility as the wikpedia article quotes the prosecutor v delali et al the elebi i case first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that had reason to know article means that a commander must have had in his possession information of a nature which at the least would put him on notice of the risk of offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates returning to the article a link within it notes that then defence minister stephen smith was in made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days there is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims in fact he publicly denied them the minister for defence is in overall control of the adf under the doctrine of command responsibility stephen smith may be responsible for war crimes anthony albanese was a member of cabinet at this time given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them however over the period of alp government he held a variety of roles including deputy pm under rudd and so it would be arguable when where or whether he could be held responsible nonetheless he was a member of a government where the adf was suspected to be committing war crimes and the government rejected action on this,0,15,17,1,8,0,6.028278520230698

paywall plumbers bricklayers cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle australia s housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government s list of core occupations for its new skills in demand visa despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas as part of the government s december migration strategy which aims to halve net migration from within two years jobs and skills australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the core skills occupations list under the current draft tradespeople including bricklayers painters roof tilers stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as targeted for consultation rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list a case will have to be made for these occupations to be included which master builders australia chief executive denita wawn said was bizarre given the industry s mammoth task of building million homes by in a submission to jobs and skills australia master builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages would be a failure given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building million homes with supporting infrastructure all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list wawn said on tuesday bricklayers cabinetmakers stonemasons painters plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the maybe list if we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis this needs to change a spokesperson for skills and training minister brendan o connor said jobs and skills australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final core skills occupations list jobs and skills australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year the spokesperson said home affairs minister clare o neil and immigration minister andrew giles retain decision making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least indexed annually successful applicants could have their visas approved in days and have their length of stay doubled to four years with potential for permanent residency coalition skills and training spokeswoman sussan ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall prime minister anthony albanese s failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes australians need and now we see him making it even worse she said there is a clear contrast between the coalition who as opposition leader peter dutton said in the budget reply will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue versus anthony albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue earlier this month the national housing supply and affordability council s state of the housing system report found the government s target of building million homes by would fall short by more than due to building industry constraints complex planning processes and lack of land in december o neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program but we need to make sure it is not a free for all with unintended consequences for aussies doing apprenticeships however the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration with the may budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to this financial year and next year and in the subsequent year,0,10,19,0,3,0,6.423246963533519

gas runs out it produces ongoing waste it is sourced from a small number of places with a small number of providers the price can rise incredibly sharply when policies national state or corporate change supply can be cut off renewables do not run out that is their whole point they do not in general produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use or at least it is significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear the production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances and because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies and even in house by businesses and individuals it is a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt hour even on initial equipment costs it is not controlled by a small number of providers it does not need large scale and separate infrastructure of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid to be maintained it does not need things continually physically transported in order to operate and it is a lot harder to cut off supply when more end consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally the only two reasons to go with non renewables are price per watt hour and politics from people who want to make all the money and or have control over fuel supplies and the first reason is rapidly approaching a non issue especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste management costs from every aspect of the operational process previously the first reason held economic sway and it made sense to go with non renewables i am not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time but it is becoming far less of one and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has over time,0,5,5,0,2,0,5.808142489980444

it takes units of electrical energy to produce unit of hydrogen energy that is simple chemistry and it cannot be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light but then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen and it is so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced it leaks and so on in the space shuttle programme only of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines the rest was lost in transit evapourated in storage and so on was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank so then you are in effect spending x units of energy to get unit of useful hydrogen of course we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective but this seems unlikely this only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for so that we do not care that most of it is wasted in the process given that fossil fuels are still being used for about rds of the country s electricity this seems unlikely to happen in the near future at the moment the green hydrogen movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue if it is genuinely useful it does not need subsidies if it needs subsidies it is not useful,0,12,5,1,10,0,5.627621113690637

surely australians are allowed to have discriminatory personal opinions as long as their actions do not violate the rights of other australians those rights should not extend to protection from subjective hurt feelings but to objective harms it is incumbent on society to educate the people to be more resistant to the effects of subjective hurt feelings but to act against objective harm free speech can never be objective harm because it has no objective agency and is entirely dependent only on the actions of the recipient there is no freedom of action because it has direct objective harm consequences,0,4,9,1,0,0,4.61512051684126

paywall the clean energy council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector it is not it is a powerful cashed up lobby group promoting the interests of wind water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in australia last month the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards airport lounges and lifts in prime sydney and melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking australia s future it is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election opposition climate change and energy spokesman ted o brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix intermittent disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid gas also would be a crucial part of the mix principally because of its agility to ramp up or down compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources yet the renewables sector has bought none of it it regards the election of a coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out it would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory it is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt not just temporarily but for good wrote giles parkinson the editor of renew economy the sector s equivalent of the china daily giles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions network capacity connection delays social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition at the end of the week the announcement that the nsw government would pay origin up to m to keep the eraring power station operating for two years beyond its planned retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal the victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with energyaustralia the owner of yallourn and agl which operates loy yong a climate change and energy minister chris bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system the theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited the australian energy market operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next years named somewhat optimistically as the statement of opportunities aemo said it had been advised of numerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between and this would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events or blackouts as most people would call them it gets worse the new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate bowen anticipated months ago and they need to get connected to the grid building km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget there is no good news for bowen or the sector in the aemo report project energyconnect the interconnection between nsw and south australia was regarded as the most straightforward high voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until july at the earliest that will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the torrens island b and osborne power stations shut in nsw delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected and victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission even if we accept aemo s optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline this is hardly the fast track transition the government promised in october bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government s per cent clean electricity target by would require the installation of solar panels a day million in total by the end of the decade it would require a megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every hours each as high as crown s one barangaroo tower in sydney about km of new high voltage transmission lines would be needed to link up the vastly expanded network,0,32,17,1,2,0,6.697034247666484

the debt burdened allan government is spruiking its wholly public births deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances treasurer tim pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry s services pallas met with one firm last week according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations and pitched the idea as a limited term contract in the style of the partial privatisation of vicroads licensing and registration arms a deal due to expire in the s the industry source who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests said the treasurer was hoping to close any deal by the end of the year a fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for victoria s bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth death and marriage certificates a cabinet minister also speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild births deaths and marriages through the private market it can probably be done better the minister said the senior mp went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer births deaths and marriages has dealt with high profile issues in recent years particularly during the pandemic when its offices were closed it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered asked if the agency was to be privatised a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership victoria s births deaths and marriages service will not be privatised but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services the government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some vicroads services was not privatisation but a joint venture partnership just seven months ago the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about billion by june that expected financial hole more than doubled to billion in the may state budget the same budget papers forecast victoria s debt to rise to billion by june in simple terms the may budget leaves victorian taxpayers with a million daily interest bill labor s primary vote has also plummeted below per cent since jacinta allan became premier according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month the survey found two thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt but additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks the coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government s management of debt and government agencies meanwhile the greens would argue such a move undermines the public service labor will also be in power in victoria for a decade come december the timeframe pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed researcher charlie joyce from the independent but progressive think tank the australia institute said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in victoria daniel andrews campaigned in against privatisation joyce said he promised to bring back the state electricity commission a further re embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the allan government which i think frankly is already fraying joyce said while victoria s debt levels were an important consideration his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often short term gain for long term pain for something like births deaths and marriages this is a government service that handles very sensitive information a private owner that cuts costs on security cybersecurity in particular could quite quickly run into trouble it would also be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost birth death marriage or change of name certificates start from in victoria but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive there were registered births in victoria last year marriages and deaths the total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in victoria for the six months to june last year was million according to the department of government services most recent publicly available annual report the same report states that births deaths and marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the financial year it took the agency on average days to process compliant applications for birth death and marriage certificates in the months to june last year its target for the period was less than days the price of general issue licence plates black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by on january driver licensing and registration are not the only services partly privatised since victorian labor came to power in december the port of melbourne was leased to a private consortium for years under a billion deal in and the victorian land titles office was partly privatised in for more than billion last year s housing statement also revealed melbourne s public high rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model when vicroads was partly privatised in pallas refused to label the development privatisation this is not privatisation in anybody s language the treasurer said at the time we are always looking to see how we can drive better services better performance but we will never divest the ownership of assets the partial privatisation of vicroads was also pitched as injecting billion into victoria s coffers under the vicroads deal the state maintains ownership of the service the victorian ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the australian services union to ensure workers kept their jobs however a consortium comprising aware super australian retirement trust and macquarie asset management was allowed to run the agency s licensing and registration for the next years,0,32,24,0,6,0,6.921658184151129

i grew up thinking you needed a sink or bucket full of soapy water then you wash from glassware to plates and finishing with the most dirty pan because of how precious water is here in australia and i grew up in drought for many years we are basically taught not to waste water america on the other hand have no concept of wastage and that can carry over to many household jobs such as washing bath towels when you go to a hotel in america they change your towels every day a lot of places here change them once or twice a week and at the end of your stay and from what i believe america is more germophobic than we are so a lot more chemicals are used i would use vinegar to clean my bench down and put vinegar in our clothes wash where as they are more likely to use bleach wipes and on the subject of washing they tend to use more smelly softener than we do,0,3,3,1,14,0,5.153291594497779

trans are always unreliable and the ptv app is waaaaayyy too optimistic thinking that you can get through on a minute connection or something as if they are not continually running off scheduled times they get held up by traffic the passenger load is unpredictable the passengers are unreliable sometimes there is a million people every stop takes minutes to load unload sometimes there are none and they fly through the stops sometimes there are people trying to bring a shopping trolley onto the tram and then the tram driver needs to have an argument and then the passenger eventually agrees to unload their trolley and shouts at everyone to help them and then the passenger starts huffing and hurling abuse and then the tram driver has to stop again to ask them to stop and then the driver has to call the cops and then the driver maybe feels a little bad for calling the cops maybe and warns the passenger to get off at next stop because the cops will be waiting at the one after that and then the passenger has to wrestle bags off the tram and all that takes time and in the meantime i missed my train,0,3,10,0,3,0,5.318119993844216

the alp have been playing games with energy policy since the rudd years they are just using it as a wedge for social democracy the goal has always been to destabilise the lnp in wealthy inner city seats listen to what they got away at the last election they won the argument by convincing the gullible public that all you had to do was vote for one party over another in order to have more cheap green energy at no cost to anyone that includes taxpayers and consumers and they did this without providing any real policy detail or proper costings if anyone dared to question this false argument they were labelled either a denier of climate change or were subject to ridicule for not understanding the benefits of renewable energy these arguments are extremely clever at the end of the day the alp is a ruthless political machine and bowen and co and experienced and professional politicians they skillfully framed the climate change debate as a political argument and they won that argument comprehensively yet here we are years down the track and facing the prospect of blackouts you cannot make this stuff up,0,12,9,1,3,0,5.278114659230517

bit off topic but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for nsw the eastern half of metro sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats and i am curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place i do not think it is feasible for a cross harbour seat to be created so i think north sydney especially as it is one of the federation seats and sydney are not going anywhere i think if one of the northern seats will disappear the one which makes most geographical sense will be warringah mackellar cannot move north of the hawkesbury as it will be non contiguous so i think it will become a thinner beach oriented seat bradfield bennelong and north sydney could be pushed east the latter could feasibly cross middle harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of manly then again the aec wants to retain aboriginal place names when possible which complicates things yet again as a side note i dislike the practice of non geographical names for electoral divisions even though in this case warringah is a geographical name i am no advocate for the american numerical system and i do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be unneccesarily specific however using the geographical centre of the seat as the nswec does leads to fewer absurdities lake george for instance existed within the seat of werriwa for only a decade and warringah possibly moving north to replace mackellar while no longer covering middle harbour just creates another pointless quirk if it is on the south side of the harbour then i think it will be messier wentworth is another seat so i could see its boundaries moving south alternatively sydney could theoretically be split between wentworth and grayndler it is oddly enough the newest of the three but i do not think that would please anyone i cannot imagine the aec removing albanese s seat either possibly barton could be partitioned also interested to see what will happen in the hunter labor seems intent on shoring up hunter at the expense of paterson demographics trending away from the party in both by drawing in maitland and cutting out the upper hunter but the geographical constraints of port stephens and lake macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an illinois mapmaker blush,0,8,6,1,12,0,5.988961416889864

i have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced ie building volumes are reducing under labor at the same time as massive population growth the reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply so labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this things they are not doing sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked ie years should be long enough to have some influence on building volumes rather than a negative result i do not think its a sure thing all renters will swing labor greens way,0,6,7,1,5,0,5.293304824724492

ros bates s statement adds important context to this story labor is now resorting to baseless misrepresentation in a desperate attempt to distract from their shocking maternity failures today the health minister was caught covering up the frequent bypass closures of maternity services at multiple queensland hospitals including major service downgrades at one of the state s biggest hospitals on the gold coast in question time the opposition asked across the chamber surely the government is not asking nothers to delay having their babies while they are transferred to other hospitals due to maternity closures with labor suggesting women could just bypass their local hospital to go to another hospital to give birth i could not believe labor was telling mothers to cross your legs while in labour this is the comment i made we have had women give birth on the side of the road in queensland due to maternity services being closed in regional areas and this is what we were demanding the health minister answer for today the comment was clearly not about the health minister it was about the alarming queensland maternity crisis which continues to worsen on her watch and is putting women and children at risk shannon fentiman is aware i am a victim of domestic violence she is also aware i am a mother for her to mischaracterise my words for her own political gain and attempt to portray me as a misogynist is deeply offensive labor has become so desperate due to their health failures that they will do and say anything to cling to power when labor is backed into a corner their true colours shine through as the health minister and minister for women shannon fentiman should be ashamed of herself i am demanding the health minister apologise and admit she deliberately misrepresented parliament whatever views you may hold on the story now at least it will be more informed,0,7,18,0,11,0,5.771441123130016

because it was a literal conspiracy theory they are using the voice to change our lawful constitution to change everything we own over to native title under the current aboriginal native titles act under that native title no one will have any ownership rights whatsoever under native title then adding that the wef new world order will become our global landlord meanwhile the factcheck stated dr galloway said any grant of freehold title private property in australia permanently extinguishes native title once private land exists there is no native title she said so the proposition simply cannot be true associate professor harry hobbs an expert in constitutional law and indigenous treaty at the university of technology sydney echoed dr galloway s comments dismissing the claims in the facebook post as ludicrous private land cannot be transferred to native title dr hobbs told factlab in an email it native title is only available where traditional owners can prove a continuing connection to their traditional lands and waters he said it is no longer available on lands that are owned privately so at worst we are looking at compulsory acquisition under existing law which has absolutely nothing to do with the voice but if we look at the article what is it actually saying on designated seats in parliament that has not been an expressed desire that has been put to me by first nations people on the compulsory acquisition of property nothing you are all getting mad about things that have not been proposed except by the opponents of treaty,0,4,7,1,7,0,5.560681631015528

the moment the word dalit comes up in a sexual assault case most of us who dominate the discourse on social media urban upper caste do not know how to feel it is a moment of condolence followed by the inability to relate with the victim or actually empathize with her suffering in some corner of our minds there is a notion that because such kind of violence towards dalits is common it is not that big of a deal it does not threaten our own safety because they are different from us we know that the power dynamics at play in a dalit assault do not apply to us we rationalize it and then we forget about it if it happens to one of us there is shock and disbelief and fear and outrage it catches our attention and instantly makes us justice warriors if it could happen to her it could happen to anybody we dominate the law order we dominate the media and we dominate the discourse we decide what is worth fighting for and what we should just read and ignore i wish people prove me wrong starting with this case,0,7,18,0,18,0,5.278114659230517

a lot of people of your age with hot blood will advise you to stand up for yourself and leave the house as soon as possible please do not do that by leaving the house or fighting back you will not solve anything you are perhaps too young to understand a few things and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful everyone goes through all life phases but here i am trying to give you some wisdom and hopefully you can use it to your advantage i was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle class family one day all of a sudden my angry father whom i loved and respected a lot but never said got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor fast forward to a few months he took his last breath in my arm and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other we take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around the only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise and i know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders and you are the young ones they should love you first but that is not how it will work you will need to talk to them with love and respect continue doing that and one day they will realize even if they do not you will have no regrets later in your life the only answer is unconditional love and respect unless someone is physically abusive in this case you must stand up for yourself and the sake of other family members,1,20,9,1,24,0,5.673323267171493

my father was a government employee he hated polling duties only very high ranking officials get good facilities although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile one time when he was a high ranking official he was attached as zonal coordinator for election observer he was provided an ac cab an armed escort and contact info for all district election officers dm in the region he left home two days before the election with the observer travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held calling police forces were needed diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done he was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses circuit houses private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep on the election eve he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine he went to the room of the dm of the district who was staying in the same guest house dm opened the door while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle some people will be like so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days most people work hard everyday that is true the only difference is that in case of election duty every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time and it is so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing you forgot to paint the finger for a voter jailed you were late for reporting to duty jailed you could not come to duty as you were hospitalized yeah jailed ec takes action first evaluate later,0,9,12,1,7,0,5.683579767338681

let us get down to brass tacks the primary conflict here is always has been religion clannishness and power dynamics some people like your parents are dead convinced that despite freedom of religion and absolute equality being enshrined in the constitution of india despite it being drilled into everyone that all indians are meant to be brothers and sisters some indians are more indian than others simply because those other indians had the audacity to be born into a different faith or a different caste and that means they should be othered and pushed out of society and eventually out of the country merely because they are in the minority to that end these fine upstanding most indian of indians will sink to any depths make up any amount of bullshit to spread fear lie steal and cheat their way into positions of power from which they can do their bidding and keep the masses distracted with this petty bullshit so they do not pay attention to the real issues holding the country back clannishness begets clannishness the minorities read the threat loud and clear circle the wagons protect their own and thus begins an arms race that will never end until people like you make the effort to build bridges and stand up against inequality wherever you see it learn read pay attention to what is going on around you as always wikipedia is your friend,0,10,12,0,6,0,5.472270673671475

it is not always about a sense of pride it is more about the market and what make sense economically for example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they are able to compete with other modernized players whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work they still use old methods why the new methods needs a lot of skills time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now financial incentive it is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access and since the demand for that kind of work does not reward extra for it being done by any modern method there is no incentive risk taking ability every new migration comes with challenges so for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales using a cloud solution they will not be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it does not add that much value compared to the cost lot of other things as well,1,18,3,1,3,0,5.41610040220442

why are people concerned about the government s profits the government is not a profit making company it is not supposed to be one edit posting because the comment was deleted after i already typed the reply because most of the govt losses are due to inability and inefficiency of their business models not because of subsidies and general expenditures if govt runs a business smoothly atleast from that business it should be close to break even point if not profitable overall agar expenditure se thoda loss ho toh that is not an issue but even general psus are making heavy losses they are supposed to make profit or they will be privatised soon enough government has no business in doing business highways are not like telephone plans or insurance do not think they can just be privatised the same way building highways is not a business for the government it is an expenditure on infrastructure they could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such who will be the customers the same people who paid taxes for building the highways in the first place people are asking for free health care and education will that not create losses but it is necessary because that is the government s responsibility to develop the country and its people,0,9,6,1,1,0,5.493061443340548

india s relationship with russia goes back to the cold war era even though india was part of the non aligned movement being a socialist nation with a vast population living in poverty we were always more attracted towards the ussr as opposed to the usa s mindless capitalism this friendship stood the test of time through various arms and trade deals even though russia and india both look drastically different today than they did in the s in today s circumstances india regrettably does not have the privilege to take a moral stand in the ukraine conflict even though most of us are opposed to it personally billion indian people need russian oil badly without which the country would come to a standstill also it is important to recognise that this is not russia s war it is putin s war and our country needs to stand by its ally regardless of their leader this is not to say that india is happy with these events we have made some pretty strong statements against the war i understand that for the nordic nations your conflicts with russia stretch back hundreds of years but that is not the case with us,1,7,10,0,7,0,5.308267697401205

once you look past all the fluff the bottom line is that there are certain people who are extremely influential and wealthy whose companies are regularly funded by russian money linked directly to putin these people are linked directly to the ruling government at the very top do the math birds of a feather flock together also china will be and has already gobbled up parts of india while the government sits pretty and acts like it is not happening so while your concern is appreciated the real danger to india is much closer to home than russia,0,7,1,0,2,0,4.59511985013459

op here is my take on this as any other person on this subreddit you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent the problem about hindu vs muslims is not one about religions it is not about cultural practices either it is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other the problem is however about isolation think about your parents how many muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting say every day or let us say every week every month every year in last years of their lives the answer you will find is very few there is very little exposure today while the world is connected more so than ever the exposure has decreased so where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others from media and i am not talking about news media i am talking about the entire media in general be it songs movies shows art literature etc anyone who is forming their opinions either in positive light or in negative light they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media now why is media so polarising is it because of politics well that has always been true to a partial extent then is it because of apathy that is essentially an outcome is not it so it cannot be that the answer to above will be the need for comfort majority population in every nation in every era in every region has always been on a struggle to survive in times past the working hours were less but the living conditions were not so much in times of current era the living conditions have improved exponentially but so have working hours and need for labour all this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences and this is why they turn to media we have seen examples countless many that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding but this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against and all of this is individual effort it is no one else s responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture no moral responsibility or ethical responsibility lies on others to improve your understanding you yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction so both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and or stand against,1,18,15,1,19,0,6.272877006546167
how is it exploitation if it creates work i do not understand the delivery drivers are paid for the pickup too right also the customers the people you accuse of exploiting are not they themselves exploited too then someone here rightly pointed out that the consumer is also time bound and taking time off to go return a product marks a half day for him which directly cut from their pockets if it is about low standards harsh timelines and other factors associated to a job then the whole of indian is exploited is not it i have worked a corporate white collar job in a reputed service based company and i have regularly crammed up am to am work schedule worked days a week with such tight deadlines that i have skipped dinner at time so many people ik are on anti depressants because their work gives them bad intrusive thoughts also if you decide to make your own returns you in a way would take out from their job as less people would be needed in the market so for the same job it is like saying t s should either up their mass entry package from lpa to lpa or should not hire at all but if they actually decided to not hire a large number of engineering grads would go jobless because t s is a mass recruiter,0,3,10,0,8,0,5.4510384535657

first of all you are incredibly brave and definitely very strong and resilient i shudder to even think of what you must be going through it is truly a great failure of moral justice but since my belief is that as long as you are alive you have potential and as long as you have potential you are valued loved and cherished as a human being if by nobody else then at least by me i would love to hear what happens next in your story you say you are you seem to be well educated so just a provocation which i would like to invite you to think about see if it helps we are conditioned to consider that the goal in life is happiness and that suffering is the lack of happiness the world should be fair people should be this or that where is it written which book question every core belief you grew up with and you may realise that none of it holds true then the decision will become about what to sacrifice and what you may gain as a result again it is about taking chances and making sacrifices people are evil also in an evil world do small acts of good for people who are less privileged maybe our power is not in what happens to us but the way we react to it all of the above is for you to ponder over here is the only thing i will ask you to do read books a meditations b man s search for meaning c radical compassion i know it sounds like some generic platitude bullshit but what is the harm,1,25,7,0,27,0,5.634789603169249

worst customer service i encountered in years red raw and at best pink in parts chicken not at all stringy or cooked literally dunked in the frier and removed and served in the time that i washed my hands lord is my witness we ordered washed my hands without using the toilet i should point out returned and food was served granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse the incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all i met with i politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said just you can have refund eventually they remade the food which unsurprisingly took x longer to make and was actually cooked through i never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain issues with food are understandable but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different and furthermore to degrade them and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube not stringy white chicken and is uncooked followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n t know your managers name when politely asked whom i can address my concerns to given the food was shocking,0,5,11,1,20,0,5.5909869805108565
i had booked a table for last night and when we arrived it was a lovely night with my partner we had a great time but i do have to admit the prices of the drinks were on the expensive side seventeen pounds for two double gins and lemonade when you can buy the bottle for the amount we had we only had three or four of that and it was a little painful to pay that price but it is what it is we liked the reserved area and enjoyed all the free goodies they gave us and the staff were lovely we would come back again but definitely before ten where the promotion of percent off all drinks was on instead of paying full price,1,8,2,0,11,0,4.852030263919617

we were up here on a little break and fancied trying something a little bit different and so while wandering around town we stumbled upon this lovely place the staff were friendly and welcoming and the restaurant was full of vibrant colours and wonderful cooking smells my only reason for not giving we have been this the restaurant again since and the same section was missing off the menu and at no point did the waitress tell us until i asked for it and it was n t available this was the turkish pizza part why is it on the menu if you do n t do enough said about that this place is great and definitely worth a visit,1,9,2,1,7,0,4.795790545596741

a great bar with great food in the hub milton keynes brewdog has a large selection of beers the staple brewdog beers and some exciting guest beers and ciders to accompany them there are also some more exotic expensive cans in the fridges next to the bar which are always interesting to try i usually grab a few to share the food is great the buffalo chicken burger is a big favourite and the service is usually brilliant this time however one main from our order was completely forgotten and then when reminded minutes after the other dishes had come out the wrong burger was delivered and so everyone else had finished and needed to leave before i got my food at the point of ordering there was also a few things not available but with no signage notes to let people know the table gives you a qr code to order food drink from however after selecting everything and attempting to check out it flags an error this happened for all of us in spite of all of this it still a good place to go and the above is not the usual standard of service,1,8,6,1,6,0,5.288267030694535

horrible attitude from the main lady no sense of good customer service right off the bat the food is barely edible no flavour at best i ordered jerk chicken a complete miss why would i trust a nigerian to make good caribbean food i do not know jollof rice i should be able to trust her with that at least right wrong burn of the pot taste mean ole auntie ca n t cook the plantains were just allright still no flavour though only saving grace was the price which is fair for the portions hence stars and not zero of course price is not shown anywhere they just make it up on the fly and add a few more pounds to the total that they swear is part of the original deal the consistently ask customers to take off their face masks to order as they claim they ca n t hear through it absolute negligence in times of rampant omicron variant i respectfully refused and immediately this one unprofessional main lady throws her hands up at the ceiling kiss her teeth at me and displays other terribly immature rude attitude urging her employee to deal with me because of it mind you i caught a cold and did n t want to risk coughing in their faces but i guess that is just me note to the crazy auntie if you are going to be such a disrespectful drama queen at least back it up with some good cooking skills like i said to them as a first time customer i wo n t return even though i really did want to try their grilled fish next,0,14,14,1,15,0,5.634789603169249
great location which was very busy on a saturday night so would definitely recommend booking ahead of time the atmosphere inside was great with stylish decorations and a great internal layout service was fast and professional although we did get asked quite a few questions that were probably not necessary the burger and moroccan lamb tasted great however the chocolate bombe was fairly underwhelming in taste and felt more like a gimmick than a nice desert the wine offered was also on a serious mark up for average quality although i guess that is typical of most places these days overall it was a nice experience and is a safe choice for anyone in the area looking for a tasty yet fun dining experience,1,11,1,0,2,0,4.8283137373023015

i have always been a sainsburys shopper but the loughborough branch needs some improvements just about all the trolleys have stiff wheels or make a racket the lady on the self checkouts on monday mornings puts a lot more importance on her conversation with friend colleague than customers and you often have to wait at the self checkout for alcohol or whatever to be approved even when there are hardly any customers this week i used self scan as usual and at the checkout it lost my entire shop i tried to get the attention of the supervisor but she was chatting as usual so i wheeled my trolley to the kiosk but no one was there i could have just walked out with my unpaid for shopping i went back and interrupted the supervisor and told her what had happened she was dismissive and said it had happened to someone else that morning and the only thing to do was to scan it all again bearing in mind it was all neatly packed into bags annoying enough but she was n t even remotely apologetic just went back to chatting it is a good job for sainsburys that i have a conscience as i was so annoyed i felt like just nicking the whole lot shame because the produce is good just some fairly serious customer service issues,0,8,7,1,13,0,5.438079308923196

a very pleasant caf bakery offering a fair amount of seating inside the popularity of this place means that there are often long queues to buy bread as for the quality of the pastries and croissants they are very tasty and come in different versions sweet and salty coffee and tea are good but nothing special the bread is fresh and crunchy i recommend the san francisco sourdough bread prices are unfortunately very high,1,8,1,0,1,0,4.31748811353631

went in for a sunday lunch without booking but luckily there was some seating available outside in the marquee a little bit strange to order and pay for your drinks at the bar but then to order and pay for your food with the server separately but it was fine just not we used to there was a bit of a wait for the server karen to take our food order but it was busy with some couples ahead of us so it was understandable and karen was so friendly and bubbly nothing fazed her when the food arrived and we got stuck in it was worth they wait my husband had pork and gammon and i had beef the meats were perfectly tender and delicious with great roasties large yorkshire and side veggies all the staff were very friendly and made sure everything was ok we would happily return for a roast any sunday,1,11,4,0,9,0,5.049856007249537

second visit here as my local cinema and which i also prefer would be showcase cinema due too facilities and personal comfort as my kids enjoy the seatin and space they can have their for i do n t mind to pay more in this case vue needs alot of updates and seats are so uncomfortable you do n t know if you should watch the movie of try to find a way of comfort sitting on seats and the seats material are awerful tearing light system for floor for guidance needs to be adjusted does n t feel like there is much air conditioning gets warm the food area also needs change as too small ca n t see much of menu everything small and crowded confusing at times as having to ask what is what or what is on offer can get annoying also the cinema sound volume needs to be louder then how they have it as you pay to be in a cinema for that expect the experience of being inside one which isint the case here as you can hear everyone around you and can be very uncomfortable to move or eat or trying to open the sweet pack a big no no price on cinema tickets and food is good for everyone i guess but alot of downside which can be adjusted i will take big break from coming back there as i miss my showcase cinema comfort,0,8,10,1,13,0,5.501258210544727
nice cinema but has gone downhill of late had to leave recently as the sound was faulty and the staff never even checked after my complaint i have also been and lights have been left on in the screen and it is just become a bit poo so sad would rather travel into central london for a better branch like soho or the wonderful bloomsbury wimbledon can burn it is toilet,0,4,4,0,2,0,4.276666119016055

one of the good pubs in the area that offers a decent seasonal menu i have tried their chicken cajun and burgers which were succulent and tasty unlike many commercial pubs i think this pub have a proper chef that make many recipes from scratch which makes it a better choice for locals to have a good dining experience,1,3,0,0,2,0,4.0943445622221

went for grandson birthday i had the pork dish the pork was very nice and the potatoes it comes with were delicious both were nice and hot it was served with heritage carrots which were only lukewarm which spoiled it for me the other dishes pizza and pasta were good the young lady who served was lovely and nothing was too much trouble it makes such a difference to a meal when you are looked after,1,5,1,0,3,0,4.343805421853684

food was quite good i had the pad thai the service was decent i wish our food had come out all at once my husband had finished his main course by the time he got his appetiser it was a friday night so they were quite busy and we waited about minutes for a table which was n t bad for how busy they were but they have this nice big waiting area by the bar and no where to sit down i think it make it a bit nicer if they just added a bench or something in the bar area,1,4,2,1,6,0,4.634728988229636

wonderful to have this type of museum in sheffield and it does a lot of things right plenty of free games for people to try and interesting items from video game history in cabinets to look at felt like they were really support local indie developers also but some simple things like having working controllers would be nice even something common and fairly cheap like a snes pad was n t replaced and broken zool is a hard enough game without using a broken controller did n t feel like it was laid out in any chronological order either would have been to show my child the early stuff and walked them through how it progressed to modern day would thoroughly recommend a visit but it a fine line between museum and an arcade,1,11,3,0,1,0,4.90527477843843
as mcdonalds go this is actually a fairly good one obviously my burger did n t look anything like the picture but that is just standard from a maccy d my only complaint was that the fries were n t full this is just annoying and something that should just happen naturally especially as they cost them nothing in the first place staff were friendly the place was clean they even had some fairly cool furniture including a sofa by the window that was actually quite comfy,1,5,2,0,2,0,4.477336814478207

wanted to come here for a while now to try the bagels and we visited on a saturday early afternoon there were plenty of seats inside to sit and we placed our order at the counter the portions were large snd the bagels were packed full which was great the only downside was the oily surface of the bagels sadly the coffee was good it would be amazing if the breakfast menu was all day on weekends too,1,3,2,0,3,0,4.3694478524670215
mother day and i decided last minute to have lunch with my son there it was fully booked but i went there to try a table for it was packed many families have lunch together for mother day at the entrance i met julian and i told him i did not have a booking but he smiled to me and said no worries i will find a table for about min later que returned and said he got a table and it was been prepared julian was so polite and his customer service was amazing he even come to our table later to apologise for not getting a better table but we were very happy with our table the waitress alessandra was lovely very nice lady and served us always with a big smile all other waiters who were bringing the meat to us were friendly and had a smile always robson was great we had quick chats while he was cutting our pieces of meat the buffet food was delicious and hot all cuts of meat that were offered to us were delicious soft and well seasoned i would like to thanks all staff and management for their service and excellent customer care it really made a difference for my mother day lunch with my son keep up the great work and service,1,20,4,1,19,0,5.41610040220442
we visited zizzi chelmsford on a sunday lunchtime we had n t booked and we a couple were sorted immediately the staff explained that we could place our order through the app or the waitress we ordered through the waitress a starter and main each and tap water i recommend tap water it came in a large metal jug with ice with two glasses and was free we got our starter within minutes of being seated the prawns were amazing i will definitely have again when the starter plates were collected we waited minutes for our mains the tables either side of us had come in ordered eaten their mains and got their bill we got our mains and the plates were collected quickly and desserts offered we asked for the bill on this occasion we did n t tip our servers because of the time waited for the mains the experience has n t put me off visiting again but i make sure i have time to waste,1,5,1,0,21,0,5.135798437050262

it is a really great idea for smaller tapas style dishes so you can try more of the menu with your mates definitely go here with a bunch of people after a hard day chopping wood it makes you feel like you deserve the flavours the chicken pakora was unfortunately a bit dry but the sauce was spot on the garlic naan has raw garlic on it which did n t hit the spot just stick to the curries and you will have a good night out cool atmosphere nice service,1,6,2,0,5,0,4.5217885770490405
i love a burger and have now tried five guys twice i was disappointed after my first visit but awarded them stars i wanted to give them a second try but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to stars the quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings like mcdonalds or burger king however the cost is to times the price of mcdonalds consistent but a bit bland or burger king prone to inconsistency in delivery service and grubby restaurants but tasty burgers this would be tolerable but the five guys burgers are immensely bland they lack seasoning or any beefy flavour they have no sear on the outside the bacon is crispy but this appears to be achieved by deep frying it has a suitably uniform colour which gives the bacon a scorched flavour it is also unsmoked a lost opportunity to make it tastier the portions of fries are generous but i would rather pay half the price for half the quantity the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you would want to inflate prices the fries are also a bit over seasoned the premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless high quality and above all delicious offering yet it falls significantly short of this it is n t bad but better can be had for significantly less for my first visit i spent for a burger fries and a milkshake which is frankly obscene i visited with my wife the second time we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries which came to we wo n t be back,0,13,9,1,14,0,5.655991810819852
i had lunch there with my family besides all the crying babies and the fact that they got my brothers order wrong i actually had quite a nice experience the staff were friendly the food came pretty quick and the portions were big the price was reasonable the drink and water fountain was also very nice and their sauces are very flavourful good work nandos,1,5,2,0,4,0,4.189654742026425
stayed here for a night with my partner we stayed in a room that was on the end and seemed to be disabled access unless all rooms are the same but we did n t mind the room was good there is a hair dryer iron board kettle tea coffee big tv and lots of power points there is a coffee machine in reception that is free to use for guests there is a small bar and vending machine but we did n t purchase anything from either we came into the hotel via the lift from the car park car park cost paid at reception is for when you arrive till midnight the following day checkout is at noon so we put our luggage in the car and went out for lunch and shopping before heading home to get to the hotel by car you will most likely have to come through the clean air zone i was driving a hybrid so there was no charge though i had to check online to be sure as i am not well versed in the zone charges and rules etc the location of the hotel is really good about a minute walk to shops restaurants would definitely stay here again,1,7,2,1,12,0,5.3471075307174685
went in for breakfast on saturday during our valentines weekend it was busy luckily we got seated within minutes because the line outside was crazy after i could n t believe that people were waiting to get inside i had the eggs benedict and my partner had the full english breakfast i would n t say it amazing as i had better but it was really nice the service was good staff were polite professional and attentive the pancakes were popular as i could see several others order it overall great would i go again not really,1,7,1,0,9,0,4.584967478670572

my family and i go to this wetherspoon pub regularly usually a couple times a week consistently the measure of the pints so called have been reduced week on week today every single one of our five pints were centimetres below a full measure having garnered the attention of a staff member after chasing up a meal which was not sent out i informed them of the situation this was not met with understanding nor apology for the consistent error just ask for a top up when they bring it out i had accepted the laconic measure and only wanted the issue noted and passed on to the requisite bar staff to avoid such poor practice in future henceforth i will always correct the staff on first receipt of the pint i will not consider it a momentary lapse due to human error,0,3,4,0,7,0,4.969813299576001
i have been ordering from here for a long time and always loved it but recently the quality of the food has gone down hill i ordered at for delivery and the chicken was so dry and the chips were extremely tough definitely not fresh which is odd when the place has just opened staff are lovely so do n t like to complain but it happened a few times now,0,5,3,0,2,0,4.276666119016055
lovely atmosphere and great food however i did feel the bar service really let the place down staff seemed too interested in having concersations with each other than serving the people stood at the bar would come back again however would nt rush back as the service really let it down,1,3,0,0,1,0,3.9512437185814275

first time having delivery from wagamama using the deliveroo app food arrived quite quickly but hardly any dipping sauce with the chilli squid no broth added to the brisket beef ramen making it very dry and restaurant sent us duck gyoza rather than hoisin pulled duck buns deliveroo will refund the cost of receiving the wrong item but nothing for the mistake on the two other dishes more care needs to be taken when preparing orders for delivery,0,1,3,1,1,0,4.3694478524670215

sadly wo n t be returning here have had food from here times and the quality decreased each time which is bad in itself however it is the people working here that will cause me to not return i and my family do unfortunately find it very hard to understand them as they really do n t speak clearly which they seem to use to their advantage ordered meals confirmed the meals about times due to the difficulty in communication and even then they tried to trick us numerous times price paid never matches their menu they forget items until you remind them and they try to say you have paid xx amount less than you need to to get you to pay again if others have good experiences with them then i am glad for you but i personally wo n t be returning here they have tried this too many times in just visits,0,4,8,0,11,0,5.056245805348308

ridiculously overpriced food you can get better at kfc for less was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at wingstop sounded very tasty on the board i ordered the box of boneless chicken fries with the wingstop flavoring and a drink what was served up however was mediocre the chicken was just warm and did n t contain much sauce on them in the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring mine arrived with a dash of flavour i do have to say the brazilian and mango habanero sauces were good though the fries with the wingstop seasoning was ok the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so i did n t enjoy it much for near i would n t have that again if i ever did venture in again perhaps i would try a burger,0,5,1,0,8,0,4.997212273764115
worst spoons i have been to so far service was subpar at best and drink orders were n t carried out correctly crockery and cutlery was handed out dirty with a lipstick like substance on a fork and napkin as well as a stained and chipped plate and glass which arrived at our table the burger i ordered had a burnt bun which was quite disappointing all of these issues were brought up to a member of staff who shrugged it off not really caring that our experience was unpleasant if i return to bournemouth and want to go to a wetherspoons next time i would try the one up the road,0,5,4,0,6,0,4.727387818712341

visited for christmas day dinner which was our first experience of eating out on christmas day we were welcomed with champagne seated in the bar area before being moved to the dinning area there was courses over the course of about hours overall the food was hit and miss out of different starters we enjoyed two but they had our orders wrong one main was the wrong main one came without gravy and by course we were asked each time if we would like food to go because they needed to clean however the staff overall were lovely and you could see they were doing as much as they could to help we felt terrible for the person left to the bar by herself they were clearly new and had to go and ask colleagues how to make certain drinks overall it was pleasant,1,10,4,0,8,0,4.976733742420574

i have been coming here with my mum and sister and friends for close to forty years today there was a text for extra free tickets for you and friends there was a long queue and when i got close to the counter i realised i had left my phone in the car i told the member of the management team i had the text but had left my phone in the car she said that fine what package do you want but then would n t give me the extra tickets she said you ca n t expect to go to tesco and get club card rewards without your card she was very sharp and rude i get there are rules but i had brought a friend as well and this interaction does not promote loyalty to newcomers a member of staff came to ask for help with a customer she snapped his head off and said i got a queue deal with it which really showed him up i went back to my car and got my phone and got the extra tickets for me and my friend she was snapping at someone else at the counter my point is if you do n t want to serve people do n t work in a public facing role,0,13,1,0,24,0,5.3981627015177525

great location for people travelling via hammersmith station and for those going to a concert at either shepherd bush empire or eventim apollo the room was much smaller than expected especially in comparison to rooms in other premier inns the curtain in the room also did n t fully shut out all of the light which was inconvenient now that the sun is rising very early one out of two lifts was also out of order during the whole stay which made getting to the room which was on one of the highest levels take a lot longer than i would liked,0,2,1,0,1,0,4.634728988229636
a lovely treat to end the week i have been to most of the everyman cinemas of which are all very classy and with high standards the esher cinema is no exception as you walk in you are welcomed with a warm cozy vibe and a lovely snack and wine bar the colours throughout were vibrant and very sophisticate the staff were friendly and approachable which is always a bonus the cinema was very clean and spacious which makes a huge difference the menue options were good also we selected a variety of things popcorn ice cream burgers etc we opted for a sofa seat which was perfect for the evening as there was plenty of leg room overall a lovely trest and would definitely recommend it r x,1,16,1,1,5,0,4.867534450455582

a wonderful spa experience though the staff were not as welcoming or as friendly as expected in such a popular and highly recommended place they have a no phone policy in the spa which means visitors can relax rather than focusing on getting the right pose for social media they now charge for flip flops so do bring your own or walk barefoot definitely recommend for a chill out experience,1,8,2,1,1,0,4.2626798770413155
the food was not as expected comparing to previous reviews it was not served as described on the menu and seemed to have been made in such a hurry that cooking it was an actual second thought the ingredients did not seem nor taste fresh and had gone past the stage of having been prepared to earlier in the day to looking like they were left over from previous night or day the cleanliness was not up to standard it is wheelchair accessible but still difficult to travel around in the wheelchair as there have been to many tables cramped in to try and get as many customers as possible,0,3,1,0,0,0,4.709530201312334

well we had a hiccup with the food due to new staff members but it was very quickly resolved and in a more than adequate way food was piping hot flavoursome and filling they have cut their drinks menu down which is no bad thing as you could spend half an hour reading it there is some air hockey tables to play and good low level music playing all the staff are friendly and helpful i had a pit burger and the wifey had a mac n cheese burger,1,8,4,1,3,0,4.499809670330265
for a budget cinema it is pretty fantastic for reference i have actually been to both an expensive cinema luxe birmingham broadway plaza and now a budget one for budget experience i was rather impressed obviously it is cheaper only per ticket rather than the i paid at broadway both have nice seating with plentiful restaurants for snacks the seats are n t as comfortable but the screen size is the same in summary if you only care about the movie and nothing else like i did with dune part two then this is a great choice,1,8,0,0,5,0,4.584967478670572

unfortunately very disappointed by the food the dynamite shrimp was nice and the pieces were big but the masala i forgot to take a picture of were meagre the dum biryani was just and the szechuan noodles were also fine but the chilli garlic prawns were so underwhelming with barely any flavour in the gravy and the white rice i ordered was stale and hard to eat i think this indo chinese place struggles with the chinese parts of the menu they probably benefit from cutting down some of the many options and polishing the popular items,0,5,5,0,3,0,4.584967478670572
was told just after our food arrived using table service that we only had mins as they were shutting the upstairs where we were seated twenty five mins later a younger member of staff came over and said we need to leave now he had also told a number of other customers the same as me and my friend still had our coffee to finish i said that we would be on our way as soon as we had finished this clearly put him and his teams back up as they headed over to the corner area we were seated and began picking up stools to very heavy handedly dropping them on the tables the team began to make comments amongst themselves about getting the job done after a few more mins we were ready to leave and as we did i was issued a few very sarcastic have a good evenings by the team at the bottom of the stairs was the manager who said they would just dealt with a technical issue and very confusingly said that was why upstairs was shut but it was all sorted now i did mention to him about the rudeness of a few of his staff before we left my friend placed a large takeaway order for both our families at home only to get home with the said order and a number of food items missing needless to say i wo n t be heading into that store again,0,7,6,0,20,0,5.517452896464707

the best breakfast place in plymouth it gets busy quickly but if you arrive before you should be able to get a table without a wait otherwise expect a queue eggs benedict were perfect liked the breakfast bagel but was n t so keen on the sausage patty on it great cappuccino be aware that you pay when you order and they ask up front for a tip even before you are served,1,5,1,0,5,0,4.30406509320417
i am not sure if my pizza hut memories are through young rose tinted glasses or if they were just better in the past but it is not great anymore service was friendly you ca n t deny that although qr codes should n t be mandatory food is bang average which would be fine if it was cheap but you are paying prices which deserve top quality food and which you can get in a very good restaurant in london but you only get supermarket quality pizza,0,8,1,0,6,0,4.48863636973214

i visited twice on different afternoons on the first visit they forgot to bring us our glasses and when they brought them over they were hot just out of the machine not great when you want a cold drink overall the place was clean and tidy and the servers were friendly and polite there is ample seating it is really strange having to climb upstairs to the toilets the days i visited were warm and upstairs was even warmer the a c was on and were seating next to the window just below the air vent after a while it was uncomfortably cold the food was as expected from any other store we enjoyed it and it was served within a reasonable timeframe,1,7,2,0,6,0,4.820281565605037
the place always has something going on constantly running out of things and removing them from the menu or stopping online collections i have tried to order times in last weeks and both times online ordering has been off they do n t deliver to my area and when i decided to last drive in and order to collect i was waiting about minutes and not a single person acknowledge me just prioritising the delivery guys this is my closest but have been driving further where i can actually get an order without any issues,0,0,1,0,7,0,4.564348191467836
great atmosphere and helpful friendly staff only criticism would be that the pool tables are too close together which when all in use can be slightly annoying great place to come for a few games and a catch up with friends great selection of beer on tap did n t try the food so ca n t rate that but saw some being served and looked great,1,7,2,0,0,0,4.219507705176107

it was decent to be fair we have been a few times previously and it has n t been the tidiest but no complaints this time we compared the prices with the wrexham one and the cheshire oaks one and wrexham was much cheaper for the same thing the drinks and service were pretty good loads of bowling balls available and the game itself was fun the kids loved it did n t eat there as we went next door to nandos so i ca n t comment on the food the arcade section was pretty good as well we and the kids had a few games of air hockey before leaving loads of parking around overall was worth going we will go again,1,9,2,1,6,0,4.8283137373023015
the place is always buzzing nice vibes good music and a cool place for a couple of drinks with friends but avoid if there is an event at wembley stadium it gets too busy and you wo n t get the same quality and service like other days overall it is good value for money,1,7,1,0,1,0,4.02535169073515
first time visiting fratello and was very impressed by the warm genuine greeting on arrival the quick service and the great pizzas will be definitely visiting again in the very near future october update seafood risotto and seafood tagliatelle ordered both slightly underwhelming in flavour with far too much very rubbery and flavourless octopus in the seafood mixture had to pick it all out in the end as there was just too much of it see photo even with lots of chilli oil which was very mild indeed and pepper both dishes were rather disappointing jan a third visit delivered with fabulous pizzas though the server seemed very confused when i asked for no ham on the quattro pizza as it is supposed to be in sections just add more of the other ingredients i do n t mind which one just not ham hence my quattro became tre would definitely recommend for their pizzas,1,8,3,1,3,0,5.049856007249537

great location free parking for guests friendly reception staff room was a bit dated but perfectly adequate for the price unfortunately i did n t sleep well as i was disturbed by constant noise from the extractor fans on the flat roof outside my window but i am a light sleeper and at least i was n t on the railway station side which would have been a lot worse sadly my stay came to an unpleasant end on the morning i checked out i had gone to bed with the do not disturb sign on the door and the chain across despite this at there was a knock on the door and it was the chambermaid telling me i had to check out at am i said yes am it is instead of apologizing and saying she would come back at she then tried to barge her way into my room persistently and very aggressively if the chain had n t been across she would have been in the room with me only partially dressed i think this is a despicable disrespectful way to treat guests and complained strongly at reception on my way out receiving an apology and acknowledgement that it should n t have happened but i am never going back to the liner,0,10,9,0,16,0,5.384495062789089
i ca n t fault the coffee here superb flavour even the decaff the atmosphere is quite hip and friendly just lost a star for slow service i do n t mind when kitchens are slow if there is good communication from the waiting staff but we did have to go and ask after minutes hopefully this was a one off being a sunday we will try again it would be worth it for the great coffee,1,6,2,0,4,0,4.356708826689592
you go in and ask what games are available if the lane you want is free you take it as it might not be free if you get a drink first as soon as you pay your game time is ticking down we paid and i went to the bar took mins to get a drink because the guy went to change a barrel and never came back by yhe time i got to the lane we had mins left out of the allocated half hour which cost should be more like flight club where you are escorted to the lane the clock starts ticking down then and the escort gets your drinks from the bar not really impressed,0,5,1,0,12,0,4.787491742782046
a fairly large and welcoming wetherspoons which was busy when we arrived duly ordered drinks and food from the table and sat waiting for them to arrive it was only at this point a large screen was rolled down from the ceiling the tv was switched over to women rugby and things became a tad unbearable the sound was so loud luckily this meant a few people left as no one seemed particularly interested in watching it anyway luckily the food arrived and we quickly relocated to a quieter area to enjoy the meal it is the usual spoons food and drinks and the staff all seemed pleasant and attentive would definitely recommend but will bear in mind that if sports are on sit at the back,1,8,1,1,2,0,4.852030263919617

a large modern updated pub off deansgate plenty of seating including a large section for eating as you first walk in ornate plaster ceilings in places that look like it was once a bank or other important building there is a small stage to one side where a band was just setting up so i can imagine it getting busy but with a good atmosphere once they have started the staff seemed more professional than the other places i would visited that day dressed in smart uniforms and aprons there was also a large selection of drinks available including cocktails,1,4,0,0,3,0,4.61512051684126
visited recently the store had just rearranged so took a while to find anything hardly no staff on the shop floor went to queue was greeted by a queue over people long one person on checkout who kept ringing for assistance but was being ignored i went off found a staff member tidying shelves asked him if he was till trained or if there was anyone who could help he replied no one else is trained it only me on the floor it not my fault blame head office they cut our hours there was an girl on the floor who appeared to be online shopping had headphones in completely ignored me when i tried to speak to her whilst i sympathise with any cuts in hours that not really a professional conversation to have with a customer felt like the whole situation was being used for an agenda baffled me that they clearly had hours man power to rearrange the whole shop but not to actually serve customers,0,4,8,1,8,0,5.135798437050262

in my quest to find a replacement for marmaris i found myself ordering from here the chicken shish was good flavour wise a bit on the basic side but it was hot and juicy huge portion of chips the salad was a big let down and the weakest part of the meal the food arrived in quite excessive plastic packaging i know i requested the kebab be separate but i feel polystyrene is just as effective and less damaging to the environment than the thick containers i received delivery was quick prices reasonable i would order again,1,4,2,0,7,0,4.584967478670572

we enjoyed a lovely sunday lunch in this buzzing popular restaurant this was the first time to hearth after hearing good things and seeing the positive reviews it was also a nostalgia trip being an avid diner in studio cafe back in the s when a student at the art college in hull in my youth the restaurant has a simple stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine it also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff we were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen the service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks but the main course food service was fairly slow we decided on courses and waited minutes after ordering for our mains which did seem too long desserts arrived much quicker within minutes the food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food which seems to be the new bar set for michelin guide rated food these days as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society portions are generous and sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful a special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion pudding which was deemed the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside the only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food as all savoury courses and gravy did seem very salty we would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating also identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff when ordering or any mention for example one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the enormous yorkshire pudding and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free which was confirmed desserts were excellent with interesting menu choices and again generous portions we would return as the overall experience was enjoyable but maybe to try the evening menu next time,1,19,1,0,8,0,5.793013608384144

i made my first ever clubbing visit here as a fresh year old a week ago and they really put the bar high it seems people have had bad experiences with the door staff but i disagree with what has been said about them admittedly i did show up pretty much as soon as they opened so crowds were n t an issue maybe that is the difference for others i was thoroughly searched which i am happy with and even had a little chat with the door staff telling them it was my first time visiting and he even gave a bit of a pep talk it was lovely i made the mistake of not brining my student id so i payed pounds for entry not but oh well still the price i was expecting anyways i had a couple of drinks across the evening they tasted good but i am convinced the vodka was watered down as my drinks tasted a bit too bearable haha mixed feelings about the bar staff some seemed quite fed up but others seemed friendly it was nice to see a range of different people from different backgrounds working in there a good presence of security and welfare staff throughout the venue made it feel very safe and the atmosphere was brilliant once it started to get busy everybody seemed to be having a really good time when you leave the cloakroom is a bit chaotic but if you wait patiently you get through it eventually for me i had a brilliant night and it seems like others did too,1,17,5,0,19,0,5.5909869805108565

clean takeaway with welcoming polite staff the food at pepe took me by surprise it is actually pretty decent the chicken portions are big and the price is really reasonable the flavours are also great too with quite a range to choose from my only gripe with this place is that the mango and lime tasted super artificial i mean when i was eating my mango and lime wings i could quite literally feel the grains of powdered flavour on my tongue the marinade tasted really grainy aside from the mango and lime sauce the other sauces i tried were decent overall a decent spot,1,6,0,0,8,0,4.663439094112067
the music is better than the food i have not been to any other branches but this branch is dirty i am referring to customer areas because of course i did n t inspect the kitchen our table was oddly bumpy around the edges too see pics the seats were sticky and had all kinds of debris on them the toilets are dirty too but they do have an accessible toilet on the ground floor which is good thing prices do n t represent good value for money but its not overly expensive the food was hot but between us we tried different wing flavours and none of them were special the lemon pepper was neither particularly lemony or peppery each bbq flavour was very similar to the next and all of them were too sweet chips were nice customer service was awful for some reason they do n t have any hand wipes available and no hand washing facilities outside of the toilets the music was really good,0,10,4,1,6,0,5.135798437050262

we fancied some seafood so decided to give this restaurant a try the food took some time to arrive and what came was very tasty we just felt it could have been hotter service was on the whole was good our waitress lara was very friendly when we asked a waitress for a bowl for shells we were told to use the bread basket to hold shells which we found a bit odd also would have been great if they gave out wipes hot towel or a finger bowl like most seafood restaurants other than that we enjoyed it and left full,1,5,1,0,7,0,4.634728988229636
we stayed at the premier inn next door and therefore booked for dinner here the service was good and the meal was delivered quickly could not fault it the only ale was the ubiquitous doom bar which is a shame they do cocktails for good value and bottles of wine are fairly priced i had the trio of mini pies and my wife the vegetarian lasagne we would definitely use again if in the area,1,4,3,0,4,0,4.330733340286331

another piece of junk meat at bought a days fillet steak which should be the very best piece of meat from the cow if the meat has been matured for days how on earth can it be that it is literally swimming around in its own fresh blood please enlighten me and in particular please enlighted the public and your future customers a fillet does not have any tendons in it nor there is any fat it is a pure piece of meat i am though aware of that sainsbury are not very good in responding to these claims possible because they have little understanding or let us say willingness of how to interact with their customers you are cheating and stealing people money selling something that is highly different to what you claim on the tin could you just be a bit honest and transparent please and my final question is that where where do i buy a piece of good quality meat in this country,0,10,2,0,9,0,5.123963979403259

it is a premier inn what else needs to be said hotel was smart beds so comfortable and rooms accessible for someone with mobility issues this is crucial what let us it down is the parking no car park attached and nearest ncp a good few hundred yards away for someone with mobility issues this was a real problem perhaps i should been more thorough with my research but every other premier inn that i have stayed at has had a car park attached to it so i wrongly assumed this would to this was the only downside for what was an enjoyable stay,1,4,3,1,5,0,4.653960350157523

a group of of us booked this place for a leaving function due to some people arriving late there were complications caused by our party the staff handled everything very well and were extremely accommodating throughout what must have been a frustrating process for them eventually we had lanes sorted out and a thoroughly enjoyable time car parking is easy with a number of facilities in the area payment for parking is best through an app we have discovered it also free after in the carpark we chose the bowling centre is located on the second floor of the building there are stairs available as well as a lift should you need it inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks quite a few arcade games are also available some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes the bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to people per lane we had lanes next to each other for our group military discount is available making it around per game table service from the bar can be achieved by scanning a qr code from the small table at your lane based on this experience i would highly recommend this place for some light hearted fun,1,13,1,0,11,0,5.37989735354046

a nice clean beefeater with pretty speedy service and pleasant staff i visited while staying at the premier inn next door i had booked online in advance i recommend you always try to do this as they book up super fast at times the staff had me seated quickly at a nice clean table the menu has been recently updated but it is n t very different to the previous one except the prices which all seem to have increased i tried the hot crunchy chicken to start which came with a little bit of garnish the hot sauce is ok but not face meltingly hot i followed this with the double stack burger with fries everything was nicely cooked and served quickly the serving staff came to my table regularly to make sure everything was ok and were pleasant all in all a nice beefeater that holds no nasty surprises,1,16,2,1,8,0,5.0238805208462765
the atmosphere is very chilled out the cleanliness is a because for concern the table and salt and pepper pots were dirty but that we thought was just about the table and being busy but we were not prepared for the filth of the crockery absolutely disgusting on the cups and milk jugs and teapots the coffee did taste nice but the hygiene left a bitter taste in the mouth we ordered a vegetarian soup and got chicken soup the panini was tasty though small and burnt on the edges the chips were cold the harissa chicken flatbread was delicious but cold the assistant manager on duty refunded the cost of the drinks on my complaining the place needs a deep clean and portions need to be considered,0,4,4,0,4,0,4.859812404361672

eastbourne time to fly high in the sky with lark locally sourced locally proud and locally revered this establishment certainly has a buzz bringing all the bees i was there for minutes and all the tables were gobbled up the brunch was a revelation compared to many places in london the pancakes with apple and butterscotch comb certainly ensured a state of eudaimonia the halloumi was bloomy crispy and rich nestled on crunchy bread the staff are encouraging and pleasant overall an indulging experience to enrich your sunday would be back soon if not for the commute,1,7,0,0,2,0,4.584967478670572
we watched a movie on small it is tiny similar size as a home cinema projector it is still nice but not what we expected for this price the only food available is disgusting and expensive cold hot dogs and tasteless nachos and of course minutes of ads before the movie starts so overall the experience might be better at home,0,2,1,0,2,0,4.127134385045092
it is a good chicken shop the only reason i did n t give stars is the fries were a bit on the short side for me meaning i had to pick up about half a dozen at a time to get a full dose of carbs and salt whereas with a longer fry size or will do the job had the chicken burger meal and nuggets,1,1,0,0,3,0,4.219507705176107

friday night nice and busy a good buzz but not too noisy we had booked at for two but one of the main guys moved us from our smallish table for two to a larger corner table good start service was attentive and friendly throughout draft cobra beer or bottled draft effes both really cold the ros wine was crisp well chilled and not too pink we had calamari which was not rubbery served in a crisp batter to start we then both had lamb from the grill as a main course minced adana lamb on skewers and lamb shish on a hollowed out rolling pin bit odd the meat was tender and tasty and both courses came with spiced bulgar wheat although we did n t think the chilli dip was chilli hot enough then some baklava which were oozing with sweetness plus pistachio ice cream a great end to a very good meal would definitely recommend,1,10,2,0,6,0,5.0689042022202315

this place is a treasure for those on a budget it is not fancy but everyone who come in seem to be treated like a regular or close friend we came in for an early bird dinner after securing a time slot of with notice to vacate the table by that is fine as that is plenty of time for a table of two you get to choose from the main menu with dishes labelled with eb by the side courses for and courses for yes that is right it is not a typo sorry i was hungry and forgot to take the pictures of the starters but i can assure you it was just as nice as the main and dessert the final verdict is you do n t always get what you pay for because sometimes you get that little something special the restaurant industry needs to survive but they also know the customers are facing a financial crunch too they did n t raise the prices to increase revenue they just added more table and chairs and an extra sitting so that they can work harder and still allow the majority to enjoy this gratifying meal,1,14,2,0,8,0,5.298317366548036
the best tasting burger of any chain i have visited bad none consosteny juicy burger sides well balanced generous with availability and range of condomints can only suggest a redesig of the garish colour scheme used for the interior design and furnishings maybe it is designed that way for this purpose but it is difficult to stay comfortably for any significant period of time within such a kaleidoscope of colour spheres hence not lingering at the place for long,1,5,2,0,1,0,4.382026634673881
the food was delicious and unique i am not sure if they should be called curry strictly speaking like something else totally in love with lamb stew and chicken rice kedgree came quite reasonable to our purse too obviously others thought so too as the restaurant was packed when other curry houses were empty,1,4,1,0,2,0,4.007333185232471
sad to say this place has gone very much downhill husband called in last night for fish and chips fishcake and chips and chicken with fried rice chips were a mixture of freshly cooked and warm ups fish was as hard as rock and totally tasteless so had obviously been sitting in the warmer for a very long time they got the order wrong and gave us two fish no fishcake all in all a very disappointing meal for need to do much better this is our local go to takeaway so might be time to ring the changes,0,3,5,1,2,0,4.605170185988092

this is definitely a place to visit they are very accommodating for special dietary requirements we were a party of celebrating the end of the year unfortunately there was a large party that came in that were extremely loud and ready which made our evening less enjoyable this was totally different to last years experience our st visit not the grille fault the other change was the menu this year was a set menu for a minimum of we had members in our group with dietary issues and could n t eat or courses and felt pressured to order more to warrant the minimum charge perhaps something that should have been mentioned when we booked great food amazing staff give it a try,1,9,3,0,6,0,4.820281565605037
i will start with the positives lovely little coffee shop we booked an afternoon tea for and made the reservation via the contact form which was nice and easy staff were friendly and attentive coffee was beautiful and our sour dough toasties were omg i feel like the price was okay for what we had and the service we received the atmosphere and regulars were lovely including the little pup visitors you can tell people love it here we will definitely be back for the main menu as it looked great my only criticisms were that the scones were very dry and almost dusty you cut through them and end up with flour everywhere from the inside which was odd for me we have had afternoon teas before but from other places at similar cost and you usually get a small selection of bite size cakes sweet treats each this tea had cakes which we cut in half to share which were ok although full i felt like it was just lacking something not so much food wise but just something i ca n t put my finger on overall though it is a lovely place and we will definitely be back,1,20,4,0,18,0,5.313205979041787
every time i am in central london around leicester square then this is a place i have to visit for a steak at their restaurant awesome food great service and great atmosphere plenty of great steaks to choose from and great menu bars dotted around on all levels and a great place to chill out and perhaps have a little dabble as well although that is not my thing but i do like watching especially the highs and lows,1,8,1,0,4,0,4.382026634673881
we were in this branch for lunch on th the fries are delicious however the burger was too oily that my partner and i felt like the meal was too heavy like if chicken is n t cook with extra hot oil in order for it to absorb less oil service is excellent everyone is very polite and they try to keep the area clean not all customers bin their food leftovers just like in other fast food places which is a total shame anyway i would totally recommend those fries,1,7,1,0,4,0,4.5217885770490405
a bit overpriced but still tasty we were a bit cautious coming here on a visit seeing it used to have a michelin star as plastered across the windows but no longer has it however the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course unfortunately this fell a little short for me but no doubt it was still good quality to start we had the soft she will crab and yakitori yakitori were pretty standard on a par with just about every other place we have had it but they are so good as it is the crab on the other hand was excellent delicate flavour and cooked to perfection for mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat it came with rice as well though so probably this was by design however rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward i found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour it was n t marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small we also had the special piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss the eel octopus and suf clam were excellent while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n t have any smoky flavour you would expect given the torched presentation overall it was undoubtedly a good meal but i can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after the price was also i felt too high our bill came in at which if it had been more like i would have been perfectly happy,1,16,8,1,13,0,5.62040086571715

i did it again and ordered too much the station cafe is exactly what it should be a no nonsense well run cafe it is clean tidy and airy service is friendly and the food is hot and plentiful the breakfast menu options should please everyone and you do n t have to wait too long to kill those morning hunger pangs there is a car park around the corner and it is a good launchpad if you are heading off by train or you are off the the high street for a spot of shopping i find the tables just a tad too small for four people but you ca n t have everything right,1,5,4,1,6,0,4.762173934797756

walked into this place for an early family dinner the place was pretty full at the time we went in but managed to get a table the service was very efficient the starters were fairly good the funghi aranchini was spot on and so was the calamari fritto the main course were a bit of a let down the pizza fiorentina tasted like something from a supermarket the base was not well baked and the ingredients did n t seem fresh the dessert panna cotta seemed to follow the main course tasted like a supermarket version overall a disappointment,0,7,1,0,1,0,4.605170185988092
very nice place if you want to enjoy anything from breakfast lunch or dinner meals to just cocktails i went for lunch and had a few starters plus a delicious salt pepper tofu with crispy noodles and vermicelli the restaurant is also very clean and staff very polite i personally do n t like places where there is loud music but i understand it is the norm mainly in these kind of restaurants specialised in cocktails despite that there were few families with children and elderly people who were enjoying having their meals,1,8,0,0,4,0,4.543294782270004
by far the worst mcdonald we have ever experienced we ordered just over of food for home delivery it arrived absolutely stone cold not just cold but like it had been prepared hours ago one of the burgers was outside of the box loose in the bag and so was the bun that was with it the drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed fries are often placed upside down in the bag rarely do you get napkins and you would think they might add straws when you order drinks every item needs to be checked before you drive away raw fries was one of the best experiences i do n t mind waiting but at least cook the food because it is generally food to go it is meant to be convenient and fast not much point being fast if the quality is c and then the customer has to park up take the items back and get them replaced there is no quality control nobody cares about what they are churning out it is fast becoming a joke as a specific restaurant please note this is not about mcdonalds overall just this specific outlet i do n t think we will opt to use it again but i doubt they care about that anyway,0,7,4,1,10,0,5.389071729816501

very good variety of fitness classes and instructors there is enough equipment in the gym and classes area to use and they provide ways to disinfect before every use the only downside is having to pay separate for the swimming pool lockers which is not much but adds up overtime what they need to work on is people booking classes as it is sometimes impossible to get a spot and many people do n t even bother to cancel and do n t show up i seen some instructors taking action and making attendees sign a registry to confirm they are booked for the session fine those who do n t show up overall very good value for money,1,5,4,0,1,0,4.787491742782046

loved my food went to catch up with a friend over brunch waiter was very friendly and quick my pasta came nice and hot but i found the chicken pieces too big the only thing which was disappointing is that you can not use a reward with a student discount i still found it quite expensive chips were ok would n t order them again though,1,6,1,0,5,0,4.204692619390966
they doubled the prices for some items and then reduced them to have them sold people know the prices so i do n t see the point also there was a long queue at the till and just one of the member of staff was working two others were chatting and laughing i had to go and tell them off and one of them said she finished her shift she could have gone instead of keeping the other chatting also it all looks messy in that store which would n t attract shoppers in the store needs some better management,0,3,1,0,2,0,4.61512051684126
popped in the cafe after dropping my car in for a service they had an offer on of either bacon or sausage bap with a hot drink for nice and clean in the cafe with nice seating served by friendly staff and opted for a bacon bap and a black coffee you also get a portion of hash browns with it sat near the back which overlooks the church and grounds so really nice views coffee nice quality and food arrived shortly after bacon served in a brioche bun nice quality bacon and lovely hash browns not greasy overall a pleasant cafe you are able to order breakfast your way but noticed the items priced at each item perhaps if they did just a breakfast special with a drink and a set price i would have opted for that i will be back to try a full breakfast but overall a tasty bap and nice coffee it was quiet when i visited but it was early morning on a week day worth a go and looked like a good menu selection,1,14,0,0,7,0,5.204006687076795

i recently visited tailors eating house a pub located in cheltenham united kingdom with some friends after a day of activities our overall experience was quite pleasant the staff at the pub were friendly and welcoming which added to the positive atmosphere of the place one of the highlights of our visit was the wide variety of beverages available they had an impressive selection of drinks from local ales to cocktails and non alcoholic options it catered to different tastes making it a great spot for a group with diverse preferences the only reason i am not giving it a full star rating is that while the drinks and service were excellent the food menu was a bit limited and some of the dishes we ordered were just average nonetheless if you are primarily looking for a place to enjoy a nice drink and good company tailors eating house is a great choice i would definitely recommend it and i am giving it a solid star review,1,18,1,0,8,0,5.123963979403259

struggling to understand where we went so wrong despite all the other lovely reviews and latte art our group were served generic baked coffee roast with poorly textured milk all promptly masked up in a take out cup and closed lid to hide the evidence so far from the experience we were hoping it ironic that across the street in ramsgate you have staples who do a significantly better job with the same product although you can get yourself a curly baseball cap with a pretentious side of vegan leather here maybe save yourself the disappointment and try another spot,0,4,5,0,5,0,4.61512051684126

update i tried the chicken teriyaki which was nice but i ordered the korean fried chicken it was not korean fried chicken it was bits of thigh meat bit chewy should have used breast in plain batter when i asked about it i was told the korean fried wings are covered in the typical korean chilli sauce and i assume sesame seeds etc so how can you call it korean fried chicken if it is just in plain batter i was n t even offered any condiments sriracha etc very disappointed i think it was for small bits of chewy chicken thigh meat in batter was n t nice anyway better food quality than kokorro but more expensive better food quality maybe because i think they cook to order on some dishes they do need to ask the council or whoever runs queensmead to jet wash the front of the shop regularly as it is always dirty,0,4,2,0,9,0,5.062595033026967

a surprising little gem in blackburn town centre nr the town hall floors with the art gallery upstairs on the ground floor there is a large collection of old spinning machines and loom which became even more interesting when the room steward began to explain their background and history especially since he had worked assembling them years ago there is a small costume section some stuffed birds an egyptian section with a mummy and a mummified head but the best part in my opinion obviously was the art gallery with the biggest collection of donated wood prints by the famous master japanese ukiyo e artist utagawa hiroshige from th century including the great wave and red fuji it is just a pity that there is no cafe serving coffee and cake or little shop selling copies of some of the paintings made into greeting cards i would have liked to buy a few,1,6,3,1,2,0,5.0369526024136295
what truly impressed me as someone with a gluten intolerance was the menu a staggering gluten free the pork and lemongrass meatballs were perfectly seasoned offering a burst of savory flavor without being overwhelming equally delicious were the chicken summer rolls accompanied by a peanut sauce that boasted a subtle chili kick adding depth without scorching the palate for mains i opted for the hot and spicy chicken pho while the spice level did n t quite reach the fiery heights i expected the broth itself was phenomenal rich flavorful and deeply satisfying my companion devoured the wok fried chicken noodles praising their deliciousness pho is n t just a haven for gluten free diners it is a place where anyone can enjoy a delicious and satisfying meal in a warm and welcoming environment,1,15,1,0,4,0,4.90527477843843

the culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary from the moment you take your first bite you are enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses let us start with the salted chicken tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful each bite reveals layers of complexity with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken next up is the seafood rice a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood succulent shrimp tender squid and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea every spoonful is a delight with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate and then there is the confit duck a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship the duck is slow cooked to perfection resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich savory flavors the skin is rendered to a crispy perfection providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath but it is not just the individual dishes that shine it is the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right with prices ranging from per dish this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality and with the added incentive of a discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt there is even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight,1,20,0,0,9,0,5.605802066295998

very convenient location just minutes from liverpool lime street liverpool christmas market and the city center friendly and welcoming staff on reception and in the restaurant the two lifts were slow and while the breakfast did taste nice it was small and was n t worth the room was decent size warm clean and the bed was comfy shower was easy to use and a good temperature enjoyed the two slides of cake available to go with a cup of tea only downside for the room was the radiator or something else that was making cloud clicking noises all night making it really hard to sleep this may well just be a fault of this one room which is why i still rated the hotel positively but i did need to get some sleep on the train back to london,1,11,3,0,2,0,4.948759890378168
having had burgers and fries in various continents and brands such as mcdonalds shake shack guys caliburger triple o and burger king i have to say this branch even though smaller has minimal seats cooks a good burger and especially proper potatoe fries freshly made unlike a competitor with golden arches that consistently serves soggy warm over salted processed fries you can learn a lot from burger king with properly cooked meals golden arches also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature as with many mainstream burger chains and franchises i find the burgers not served up to c cooking temperature its always warm and there seems in the uk no food and safety like the us to require cooking and serving your burger hot at burger king seriously fix your app heck contact me and i will work with you on it,1,6,3,1,9,0,5.135798437050262
this place is pretty good for an event team building bit of fun in a group i found it really noisy but had some great fun games in there including karaoke shuffle board pool axe throwing darts and other games that i did n t play i never ate so i ca n t comment on the food enjoyable evening may have been better if the venue was bigger to disperse the noise better,1,9,2,0,4,0,4.31748811353631
i am mcplant mad now so visit usually once a week service is what you would expect in mcdonald same with the atmosphere the vegan burgers are delicious though its great that they did a double mcplant however have already got rid of it only came out january in favour of adding an extra vegan patty for which is cheap but overall now costs over more than the original double mcplant a treat once in a while regardless i highly recommend the mcplant,1,6,1,0,3,0,4.430816798843313

a friend and i visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on instagram as well as some recommendations i start with the only positive thing i can remember about this unforgettable experience for all the wrong reasons the decor and interior was to a high standard the food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place the cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request an unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food the whole portion was just one giant blob it made no sense we left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything other than the chips the service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately or tables so the service was very slow indeed while i had nice things to say about the decor the temperature inside was comparable to the outside we visited late feb as the ac was blasting out cold air constantly we begrudgingly paid our and left to find another place to eat the google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what i had i can not agree with them,0,11,3,1,14,0,5.3981627015177525

great place for nepali cuisine panipuri steam chicken pork mo mo chilli chicken mo mo fried chicken sausage would have rated it if it was deep fried additionally sausage coated with oily spices could take the taste to the next level pork jheer it was over cooked fried resulting in losing the juice from the meat which made the meat crunchy chicken choyela sadly the rating is as i would name it fried boneless chicken instead of choyela it tasted nowhere near of choyela sweet lassi toppings with smaller pieces of cashew or raisin or khuwa would make it mango juice milk coffee,1,2,2,0,1,0,4.6443908991413725
downtown thai restaurant with authentic flavours offering the tapas set menu at lunchtime for those not quite used to thai spices it can not go wrong with the salt and pepper tapas set it includes fried calamari amazingly flavourful chicken wings chicken curry and rice the thai milk tea is also authentic there is also a green papaya salad with the same flavour as the streets of thailand the service is pretty good but the food is served very slowly almost a minute wait at lunchtime a tip of or is automatically added to the bill although they state that it is discretionary it is hard to say no in this case,1,2,3,1,0,0,4.727387818712341
i ordered takeout from amigos and savored their exquisite spread featuring the renowned boss burger alongside peri salted chips and chili cheese bites the boss burger was a culinary delight boasting succulent perfectly cooked medium rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite though i usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche amigos choice did n t detract from the overall gastronomic experience the peri peri salted chips were executed flawlessly retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess moving on to the chili cheese bites despite a slightly elevated saltiness they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors however the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the reese pieces milkshake this decadent treat boasted a creamy texture elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter chocolate and premium quality ice cream each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression in conclusion my takeaway experience from amigos a halal establishment was exceptional every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates i enthusiastically recommend amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence,1,15,1,0,4,0,5.389071729816501

so i was looking forward to late lunch from this place as i had not eaten all day i ordered a double grill beef burger and loaded fries individually and the total came up to over i thought this should be good and tasty based on the reviews i requested the fries to be cooked crispy as let us be honest most fast food establishments fail at this mere task so my food arrives and on first impressions chips were soggy and not crispy as requested and tasted very salty the burger again nothing special size of patty to bun ration just did n t make sense taste was was ok nothing special now this could be just a one off scenario as everyone has an off day but i suggest based on the prices they deliver food worthy of it,0,7,1,0,8,0,4.955827057601261

the store is acceptably clean tidy and fairly well stocked the let down is the poor customer service and the inability to take a trolley to the car the staff are disinterested and the supervisor could n t have cared less for customer service they could n t even remember their digit log in code to void an item and everyone now knows their pass code as a retail manager myself i would certainly look to tidying up the attitudes and quality of service for a mid sat shift i would be looking to ensure the staff putting out stock were on tills instead a queue of people with big shops needed to be addressed quicker,0,6,2,0,2,0,4.762173934797756
fantastic service great atmosphere good selection of beers food was very tasty and portions very generous chicken was not as crispy as i though but delicious and i found the strips and onion rings to be a bit too oily by my partner thought the chicken burger was n t at all still will definitely come again and recommend to others,1,7,0,0,3,0,4.127134385045092
came for a cocktail a pint and some nibbles with my partner drinks we each got the same cocktail the pop tart i know that some cocktails are short but this one was really short in the picture attached you can see the tiny glasses with the single massive ice cube each in them those are the glasses used for the cocktail yes with that colossal ice cube the cocktail was nice but nothing special definitely not worth pints are on the standard high end side i believe about a pint nice lager food we got the pork bao buns tuna tostadas and padron peppers the pork bao were nice the tostadas were very mild different to what i expected they were japanese inspired more than mexican a very interesting taste worth a try the padron peppers were the star of the show great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others which makes sense as it is just battered peppers but they are delicious interior cute decor the bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora like sink it is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning staff service the staff were lovely special shout out to the guy sorry did n t get your name working on the evening of the th of april he was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome this venue may be more suited for a professional meeting special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than i do but as a hospitality worker myself a bit too pricey to be worth it for a long stay considering the products i would still come back here for the delicious padron peppers and a pint,1,24,2,0,11,0,5.723585101952381
lovely place to pop into for delicious food the salmon salad is a favourite of mine service is always polite and friendly needed to use my torch on my phone to read the menu when you go at night the choice of drinks and cocktails are nice the toilets are clean and use motion sense lighting lovely hand wash lotion and reusable soft hand towels which is good for the environment,1,9,0,0,4,0,4.276666119016055
the drinks we had cocktails were more expensive compared to other places by about on average which adds up very quickly the set menu for lunch was really tasty but most of the options have an additional charge which makes you wonder why they bother with the set price so low increase it slightly and makes the food choices standard my friend who accompanied me was vegan and she also only had option for her food choices and the only vegan dessert had an extra charge as well which i thought was unfair the waitress did offer extra of something as my friend did n t like something on the only main meal option though which i thought was nice overall though we all had a really lovely time the decor was high end the service was prompt and efficient the food was super tasty and the cocktails were delicious from me,1,10,3,0,9,0,5.030437921392435

came here at pm on a friday night and it was empty what ever happened to fish fridays above all the plaques newspaper cuttings and famous signatures i found myself most surprised by the prices that could compete with london the batter of the fish is thin golden and crispy the best type i ordered a regular and i did n t find myself getting tired of the chips which never happens tasty the salad went very well with the beige event especially the red onion nice fresh and now we are surpassing london prices all in all a charming spot but a star dropped when factoring in the hefty price for fish and chips pp,1,6,2,0,4,0,4.762173934797756

lovely quiet clean room comfortable bed we slept well reception staff at the hotel efficient and friendly unfortunately breakfast was disappointing loads of items missing from the cooked menu option stack of clean plates i had to move four dirty plates before i found a clean one nothing topped up croissants rubbery butter left in ice taken out of packets the whole breakfast area extremely dirty no service with a smile the breakfast manager just stands at the front does not top up anything she has only shown herself to be extremely lazy,0,10,7,1,3,0,4.543294782270004
nice concept where you can order from many different vendors via the qr code on your table the cocktails from the main bar were brilliant and the food from junk was lovely it was just a bit cold though the honeycomb ice cream sundae from soft core was perfect and had plenty of caramel sauce only feedback would be that it could be a bit cleaner there were many food runners but i did n t see anyone properly cleaning tables or the ground except to pick up drinks cups,1,5,0,0,3,0,4.51085950651685
as someone who leaves honest and gleeful reviews because i know they help people decision and people businesses this was imperative because of your dishonest reply about this meal i was truly expecting to be wowed because of the great reviews i do n t know if it was the chef on duty or if everyone was tired and did n t care about the customers but the experience was nothing to write home about atmosphere the interior is picturesque and has great lighting but when we got in there were still used plates on a table or two the table beside us was sprayed with cleaning agent and was just left there it began to sting my eyes had to remind our host to please wipe off what he sprayed on it food the starter was just ok the skewers were n t well seasoned and i made mention of it the linguine pasta was cold and so oily there were no sauces or dips at all and when i asked for chilli i was served mild sriracha sauce swimming in oil the food was so greasy i used up our serviettes wiping oil off my mouth my husband asked for tomato sauce and was served ketchup had to force our way through it because we were very hungry i told the host i did n t enjoy it we wanted to order desserts and asked for the menu infact but the main was so bad we called it a wrap there other the menu is very limited we noticed at least two customers walk in scan the menu and walk out an older couple who came in sat for almost minutes before they were attended to i was almost going to take their order because they just sat there they left without dining i was soooo hopeful this was going to be a usual for us but i could n t help feeling it was a waste of,0,16,6,1,26,0,5.802118375377063
nice and spacious seaside pier entry is free and they have various areas selling food at the front and some snacks further in there are arcades and a small funfair if you go further in saw a pretty restaurant right near to the end as well suitable for all ages and recommended it was a bit rainy and overcast on the day so did not see any sunset but was still lovely,1,6,1,0,1,0,4.290459441148391

excellent location and personally had lovely food and lovely staff my only grip is that the noise insulation is n t good i am here for work and done some long days so just want to get my head down but the entertainment is too loud for me my own fault for not realising it would be throughout the week but worth people knowing if they are working and not on holiday otherwise rooms are super and i am impressed with the security getting to the rooms feels safe kp hassle checking in billing food back or checking out would stay again if there was a quieter room,1,12,1,0,6,0,4.6913478822291435
we went to see the divine beauty experience at the cathedral tonight and had a very pleasant experience there was a technical problem that delayed our entrance resulting in a minute wait but it seemed to go quickly i could have done without the drop in temperature though the show comprises of projected christian images onto the walls and ceiling with a specially composed soundtrack i actually enjoyed the music as much or possibly more than the images it lasted around mins and the room was not over crowded so all had a good view the imagery felt a bit random despite the theme and some of it was abstract i think it would have been more powerful if it had told a story strangely i thought the setting was a distraction but that is probably just me the show was enjoyable and very competitively pricef but i am not sure if it is something that you would see more than once,1,8,5,0,9,0,5.093750200806762

all meats were severely overcooked requested steaks one medium rare and one rare both were criminally well done and bone dry all chicken was also dry and overcooked the barbecued chicken was in fact boiled and was very obvious all the food came in no specific order mains before starters dishes missing components and even some dishes not arriving at all the service was not adequate the waiter spilt an entire glass of some sort of fizzy drink on one of us and only said sorry bro and wiped it off with a lack of effort the restaurant was way too crowded and very very noisy the manager gave us off of the bill but that was not an acceptable mean realistically we should not have even paid just stay away from here to save your bank account and patience,0,4,6,1,4,0,4.948759890378168
went here for a christmas party and this is the same venue two years in a row the food was great and the service was spot on the evening entertainment was fantastic both years as well i have heard good reviews for the hotel but have n t ever stayed myself was a little disappointed that the only bottled peroni they had was the gluten free version not a fan,1,8,1,0,1,0,4.2626798770413155
i have heard good things about storico and i was n t disappointed with the food i really enjoyed my authentic pizza and it was great to be cooked in a wood fired oven it gives a better taste in my opinion even better that they offer a gluten free pizza base option for my allergy partner the other menu option is pasta prices are good it is a small restaurant booking ahead advised my opinion is that the lighting could have been brighter,1,8,2,0,7,0,4.442651256490317

i do n t think the lady who greeted us understood we had booked i kept saying we have booked she kept saying table for two she put us on a table right next to the toilet away from others up a step and away from the nicely set tables our table had any old serviettes where other empty tables were red and beautifully folded there were filthy windows at the back of restaurant to one side of us huge cobwebs hung at the side of fireplace where a skirting board held it up along with cobwebs between a christmas tree and storm lamp on the fireplace it is now may there were christmas lights on the logs in the fire well the fireplace itself looks like it came out of a local dumpit site this place did not have any of the drinks i chose medication stops me having alcohol so i had to have water my caprese salad came without balsamic vinegar so i got up to ask for it the lasagne was inches square the smallest i have ever seen it was swimming in tomato sauce the penne dish went cold quickly and was soon dried up when the food arrived the waiter shouted at us not spoke then thanked us in german we are yorkshire through and through we had to get up again to ask for desert menu and chose one but could we have two spoons please the waitress forgot what we wanted so came back when we went to the bar to pay the bill was not ready some tables were still not occupied when we had finished we were glad to leave,0,10,5,0,23,0,5.638354669333745

first time trying uyghur food overall very delicious mains and great value for money lambtugur dumplings delicious dough is thicker than other asian dumplings i had almost similar to a pelmeni the meat is well seasoned and goes well with the vinegary chilli oil diced leghmen was intrigued by the idea of diced noodles and it definitely delivered there was a great crunch from the veg the sauce was spicy numbing and a little funky which was delicious kept having more etles spicy trotters the sauce on this is truly exceptional i personally love the texture of trotters so i really enjoyed this dish maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n t like the texture but still loved the sauce honey cake dense and oddly cold was n t the best honey cake i had if i were to come to etles again i stick to the mains the staff is friendly food comes out quick overall great value for money with large portion sizes enjoyed it,1,21,4,0,7,0,5.153291594497779

rooms adequately clean though corners of bathroom were left out i am fussy though beds were comfy quiet room room too hot on the morning of we all had breakfast which was tasty the lady running it seemed super stressed and rushed off her feet which i am sympathetic about however her stress made me stressed she was short with customers quickly rattled off choices sighed and tutted just pointed quickly when asked where something was and was actually abit brutal to a young male waiter who possibly had less experience but certainly had a better attitude sorry but for me a pleasant manner is so important i have been a waitress myself back in the day and despite being super stressed and busy know that a smile can make a real difference to someone experience maybe some customer service training is required and naturally more staff to limit this behaviour,0,9,6,0,6,0,5.0238805208462765

soulless place poor customer service and expensive three customers were there and given a number each and called out by number when orders were ready took ages it really does n t take much effort to remember three customers orders as it makes it a much more pleasurable experience s a customer and less robotic chips took minutes to cook and no warning was given that they would be cooked from fresh they were hard and over cooked waste of my time and money,0,5,5,1,1,0,4.442651256490317

we recently booked a th party here for a large group of people the management team was extremely accommodating of our needs and allowed me time to set up the tables and area of dining how i wished provided me with an extra table for the cake we pre ordered our food which made the evening run amazingly and the bill was paid before the guests arrived it is definitely an easier way to do it the staff who served us were also extremely efficient and food came out at great speed when needed the manageress attended to us so well even when there was a small issue with a meal i personally spoke to her at the end of the evening and gave my personal feedback which she took on board i would point out that the one star review awared by another guest my father was unjustified and not a true reflection of the whole night we will come back to this restaurant as its now our rd or th visit yes some improvements are needed which i again addressed and i hope they are sorted out its a great location and i wish the restaurant all the best see you again soon,1,13,0,0,19,0,5.327876168789581

a big store with a big selection of foods and non foods quiet when we visited today but there was still a small queue to get in and up the escalator we spotted a small tv which was just the size we had been looking for but there was no obvious way to buy it the sign said ask at the desk near the tvs but another sign on the desk said it was permanently closed ask a member of staff for help we looked about but only seemed to get the attention of a security guard we admitted defeat and picked up a few odds and ends instead and left the store a good store for variety but best stick to groceries here,1,5,2,1,5,0,4.8283137373023015

i regret to share my recent disappointing visit to mcdonald in birmingham the quality of the fries which has been consistently subpar seems to be deteriorating further the customer service experience at the counter was notably poor with the staff member displaying rudeness additionally the beverage i ordered was served at only three quarters of the cup capacity i believe mcdonald should prioritize substantial improvements in both customer service and food quality within the uk the fries in particular have reached a point where they are barely edible,0,4,4,0,4,0,4.48863636973214

alright i have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding superbowl in barnsley but in fairness i think some are a little harsh to say the least the superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry for those that like to take the staircase there steps too once you get inside of the room where the superbowl bowling arcade and crazy club play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside including the noises of the machines they also had some good music playing whilst people bowled have to say personally i love the look and feel of the place this place is going to be popular with families kids and teens through the holidays my daughter who is years old played inside the crazy club play area for hours straight albeit we initially attended at am it turns out barnsley super bowl does n t open until am on weekdays now and google or their website has n t been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go i would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the internet the play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n t the largest play area and on a weekends i was told it gets super busy so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until am when we went the entire place is pretty good the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages you can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price there are plenty of toilets at the location and i have to say anyone i saw inside superbowl barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face i try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a ghostbusters teddy and did n t managed to win one ha maybe next time i have attached some pictures of our day at the complex further to this it our little girl enjoyed it so much that she cried when she left so it is appealing to kids,1,35,6,0,22,0,5.988961416889864

their lunchbox choices and fried noodles are the best bargain you can find anywhere around sale i love their nasi goreng indonesian or malaysian fried rice and the available choice of pad thai sauce for the plate is another appeal for me their sushi choices although limited are very good as well with the best value for money you can ever find around greater manchester all their food items are nice but the portions are slightly small and have actually decreased in volume throughout the course of the past two years since it moved to its current location still with the good prices it has great value for money and is seen as a bargain with some rather authentic asian dishes,1,13,1,0,4,0,4.804021044733257

large and fairly comfy brew pub grill in the centre of cambridge the independent brewery offers a fair selection of its ales on tap but my choice misty river pale ale was n t quite so good i did n t have time for picking another one alas but it is a good looking brewpub that will appeal to families as there is also an attractive and moderately priced menu,1,4,1,0,2,0,4.2626798770413155
so i have n t judged the food as by the time i got there it was all gone which i think is fantastic and my sister stole my pattie what i will say is it was a fantastic friendly vibe i really appreciated the family friendly feel and young polite gentleman i can see already what this restaurant will grow to and hopefully for their sake some air con cuz issa a wow and look forward to trying their food when i next visit they have a pit so really excited about what is coming out of that congratulations to the owners clearly doing well and nice to see tottenham high road developing in this way will update,1,12,0,0,9,0,4.787491742782046

we went there saturday afternoon round very quiet waitress was friendly nice quick service since after we arrived other parties joined i had the prawn toast delicious packed to the top with prawns i asked the waitress for a recommendation she suggested the ran noodles with minced pork it was so good spicy but not too hot and flavoursome the pak choi needed some seasoning but mixed with everything else it was fine my first had the crispy chicken with spicy noodles,1,7,0,0,5,0,4.418840607796598
had a lovely golf experience however it was quite small you could easily bump into another group and your golf ball could easily go to the next hole if you hit a bit too hard all the same it was fun and quite challenging the drinks were a bit costly the staff were very friendly and the deco and ambiance was brilliant would definitely recommend,1,9,2,0,3,0,4.189654742026425

it is a lovely little neighborhood costa shop but please guys clean your portfilters and milk jugs more frequently because i live across the road and pop in regularly and they are just never clean the coffee station is visible and sometimes the mess there really bothers me and you can taste old coffee grinds in your coffee i have also been served milk that is clearly gone off recently so please just make it a little tidier,0,6,2,0,6,0,4.3694478524670215
comfy and relaxing coffee shop right in the centre of woolwich in general gordon square the coffee is delicious with a nice selection of other drinks pastries treats sandwiches one of the reasons i continue returning here is the accessible location and super comfortable leather seating and huge windows where you can people watch to your hearts content the staff in here are friendly and i am always greeted with a smile the vibe is chilled with green walls on the interior wooden tables framed images and a section on the wall with clocks set to main cities around the world the place is kept very clean so you wo n t see tables with used coffee cups lying around there is also an outside seating area where the train station dlr bus stops and taxi rank are all in sight along with the main square which is surrounded by all kinds of shops including a big tesco extra bars hair salons ice cream shops etc definitely worth a visit woolwich coffee visitwoolwich southeastlondon,1,13,2,0,5,0,5.1647859739235145
an older hotel which is in the perfect location good for a weekend away but it is feeling a little old rooms are comfortable and clean some are fabulously large with great views parking in brighton is very expensive hour in some places take a train or park on the outskirts and use the cheap buses good food but as brighton suffers from huge influxes of tourists when the sun comes out the bar can struggle on the hotter days but the large street patio and sea facing rooms are fabulous to watch the world go by or to use a base for days out on the seafront a lanes or kemptown,1,9,2,0,0,0,4.727387818712341
overall a nice place to enjoy a satisfying lunch the price and portion were reasonable the response time was not too long the only thing i have to say is that the place needs to be updated and cleaned well the table was greasy and appeared to have not been wiped before we arrived thankfully we had cleaning wipes with us and did our own cleaning before the food arrived,1,5,0,0,5,0,4.2626798770413155
i got the savers lunch meal i was nt sure which fillings were included but the staff were very helpful i got the nacho chicken i took two bites and nearly threw up the taste of the chicken was vile almost stale and was still pretty cold even after being toasted the staff were very lovely helping me with my order and opening the door for my pram although the food has put me off ever having subway again,0,5,1,0,8,0,4.382026634673881
we came here on thursday around pm it was fairly busy but we thankfully booked so did n t have to wait long i would suggest asking for a table away from the front door if possible we had some really lovely food the menu has are real range of options for every one and some great vegan options i was really happy with the vegan lasagne and the dessert was the highlight the only downside i would say is that you constantly have uber eats delivery drivers coming through the restaurant that are pushing past you at the table alongside leaving the door open so when your seated near the front door your constantly getting cold so having to get up to close the door it definitely ruins the atmosphere when you trying to enjoy your meal,1,7,2,0,12,0,4.9344739331306915

popped into this place for a meal lunch found the app too annoying to use so i ordered the old school way at the bar plenty of spaces if you like spacious fine dining i opted to sit near the escape doors at the back of the venue as the last time i was in the same venue it got pretty ugly and although this time my visit was during the day i opted for safety over risk anyway it is very cheap two meals and two drinks for just over that is fantastic if you are on a budget however my meal was n t edible additionally the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us now i am not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day either way it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate i did need the toilet whilst there the journey to the ladies took me as far as peterlee i am sure but the toilets were very clean if not as cold as a mortuary the back is quite pleasing on the eye i can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving interesting experience nonetheless,0,14,4,0,17,0,5.3981627015177525

having been told how good this place was we were really disappointed the food did n t have a great amount of taste and the ingredients felt a little cheap the experience however was n t helped by the customers on the next table to sit there gassing up on beer then just belching the night away very loudly with a limited vocabulary of words or should i say word that began and ended with soooo classy not sorry but not the place for me,0,3,3,0,3,0,4.454347296253507

very disappointing i am a local and this is my second visit the first several years ago was dreadful the second today was n t great ignored upon entry very quiet got a table with a view dog hairs on the seat no menu so had to ask for one picked a sharing platter for of us not enough for a child tiny portion with x miniature pieces and dips had to cut one in half to share and a tiny side salad not what we expected and definitely not a sharing platter we told the waitress who said she would tell the chef who obviously did n t care the only good thing is the view we do not recommend it,0,8,5,1,6,0,4.812184355372417
my visit here was enjoyable with a lovely ambiance and excellent service from cristina our waitress however the lack of indication regarding spice levels on the menu left me unprepared as someone who is n t particularly fond of spicy food while i understand that mexican cuisine often incorporates spicy elements a heads up would have been appreciated additionally offering a side of sour cream could enhance the dishes and cater to varying tastes despite these minor issues the restaurant provides a pleasant dining experience overall,1,6,1,0,4,0,4.465908118654584

i visited the odeon on new street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area i imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure to start there is n t really anywhere that close that is reliably available for disabled people some street parking is n t far away but it is a gamble if you are going for that route and tight on time for your movie the cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the odeon sign obscured the entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem i say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently i do n t know if you can make it down to that area without assistance the biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay one drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as i said i could n t try myself to see if you can use them without aid the disabled toilet was disgusting it did n t look like it had been cleaned all weekend this was at pm sunday and was quite small so not much room to maneuver if you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you i can imagine it would be very troublesome then i made my way to screen which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan a rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side the issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen because of this i nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door the quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean personally however i would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially it would be a case of needs must for me to visit again,0,14,5,0,24,0,6.035481432524756
took my nippers there as an arranged half term thing i was very much looking forward to it with the promise of a huge selection of retro games on offer and the kids were keen to try out the vr and ps etc it was very quiet when we arrived with us there were probably only another kids there the retro games were on arcade machines they were tiny though a modern arcade machine not like the ones in the arcadea when i was young i am sure these ones use a lot less power but when people try to play at the same time you really are squished in close and generally it is hard to play some a good selection of street fighter games sonic boom and some other games i was very happy to see joust on one of the machines love that game and wasted a lot of my youth playing that the kids played on the nintendo wii but there was no vr to be seen maybe it is hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it the kids fired up the xbox but it only had controller so they could n t play together which was a shame a huge selection of board games were available which was ace too a nice place to hang out and hopefully it will be supported by the locals,1,18,5,1,10,0,5.459585514144159

we tried this italian restaurant in ruislip for a late brunch and were impressed with their two course early bird menu which is very good value at per person and delivers in terms of food quality i went for the parmigiana to start which was well balanced and simply scrumptious for my main i tried the rigatoni alla boscailo which was a mushroom pasta with a gorgonzola and cream sauce vegetarian pasta frequently disappoints especially when on a set menu but this certainly did not you will find great service in mamma rosa and it is so nice to find a decent italian restaurant a stone throw from home,1,8,1,0,5,0,4.700480365792417
this is a nice restaurant with a good really classy cosy decor inside the food on the whole is very good the duck salad is delicious calamari is nice but nothing extraordinary the duck curry is tasty and good flavour only thing is rice portion is very small the steak is very nice and good quality of meat and cooked well the chips are nice too the service is really excellent and friendly drinks are probably good but i sadly did not like the cocktail i ordered polar bear ice blue one overall really lovely meal and restaurant and would definitely recommend if you are going to the ivy you likely know the way it works and sort of thing on menu it expected that chips sides come separate and menu is not that big unique that is just the ivy but still really good,1,19,1,0,4,0,4.983606621708336

we had a disappointing visit to the king ransom yesterday firstly i was charged over for three soft drinks which thinking back seems expensive secondly after deciding on what we would like to eat i had to return to my party twice because the food we wanted was n t available after a good wait one sandwich arrived with two sides of cold fries around minutes later the three remaining sandwiches and wraps arrived with the another sides of cold fries all sides of fries returned to the kitchen to re heat surely a basic order of sandwiches wraps and fries should arrive at the table together two of the fries were n t what we ordered also however three of the sandwiches wraps were nice then we decided to order puddings but after waiting over half an hour we asked for a refund all staff apart from one girl were disengaged and unfriendly no senior staff or management were visible we had to clear our plates away as left sat on the table for ages we left feeling very disappointed you have done a lovely job doing up this pub but the staff and food do not match this,0,8,5,1,13,0,5.303304908059076

lovely venue with friendly staff and good service food was varying in quality between dishes three of our party had a calzone and they all said that it was very good i was told by another member of our group that the vegan rainbow lasagne was enjoyable if a little stodgy the chicken calabreze was a bit burned to the bottom of the pan and the sausage ragu did n t have much taste to it this was reported to serving staff who took the two meals off the bill the deserts were delicious the waiting staff offered us the option of selecting deserts from the main menu and combining it with the christmas course offer which some of our party opted for the kids were given colouring paper with quizes on and crayons to complete them this was a lovely touch thank you update excellent staff very efficient on a super busy evening we had booked the table for but it was so packed that we had to stand and wait for tables to clear before being seated minutes later staff were super apologetic and were very attentive food was delicious and the flat white was lovely considering it was busier than our previous visit i am super impressed with the standard of food tonight thank you,1,20,0,0,11,0,5.389071729816501

at first glance you notice black coloured rooms that highlights the certain atmosphere and the colour style of the place making it pretty cozy to be in however i would add a bit more decorations to fulfill this feeling the food itself is amazing in my opinion it is fully packed with tasty filling which also destroys your hunger by just eating one full meal i liked the wide range of options especially for fries where you could choose one from types of the fries the fillings of the kebab i had are decently harmonically combined price are relatively low considering that the ood is worthy i payed pounds for kebab fries and a drink nothing special about the service although i am really good in speaking english the one who took my order was patient enough to repeat some questions to me there are take aways available no parking places a lot of space inside so it is not difficult to find a place to sit decent lights overall this establishment does worth your try,1,11,5,1,12,0,5.176149732573829

good food and good service recently i had a medium big tasty meal there for lunch i was glad that there were at least touchscreen order machines in there and the one i used was very easy to touch and the most important i received my order in minutes this was the fastest service i received from mcdonald in months the burger was warm and tasty drink was good but just a bit disappointing that the medium fries only got half of the packet i asked the staff to give me a cup of water and funny thing was the water had some oasis taste with it the toilet was relatively clean quite impressed with the new flushing system and a staff was just sweeping the floor and helped me remove the paper which stuck under my shoe thank you in conclusion i really enjoyed this meal,1,12,2,0,12,0,4.997212273764115

i had this place on my list for a while now i took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife a stunning restaurant with a great ambient atmosphere we got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around it did n t take long and the restaurant was buzzing it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign the menu is very good with extensive options including a tapas option the drinks menu is excellent including non alcoholic drinks and mocktails we tried the scallops which we never tried before definitely a hit this was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a min wait at least we knew it was getting cooked fresh my wife had the steak and i had the lamb i never tried a lamb dish like this a very different way of serving lamb a dish i enjoyed but sadly would n t order again the gravy was far too thin watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce the chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well a beautiful combination there are many attractive options on the menu so even if you picky there is something for everyone the dessert menu has some great options too being a diabetic i did n t want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding sadly right next to our table one of the customers passed out the restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful they did n t make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual the downside was staff put on the air con to provide the customer with some cool air which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected go cold all in all a great experience i ca n t fault it beautiful menu great atmosphere very good staff and definitely worth it,1,33,6,0,20,0,5.8522024797744745

i really love the food very reasonable prices good quantity and quality of food the ambience of the restaurant was really nice with some indoor plants which makes it warm and cozy but the place i do n t know for some reason it really cold when we visited so it felt a bit uncomfortable the service was quick and good staff are polite everything pretty good except for the fact they do charge service charge and do n t know why a person is asked to pay when it do n t go to the staff but the restaurant itself it would be better to tip the staff for their generous service than paying to the restaurant for god knows what also the service charge is bit too much to pay for a meal bit annoyed still i enjoyed the food hope they will remove the service charge though,1,12,4,0,4,0,5.017279836814924

we have been a customer of wildwood northwich since it opened the food is always delicious and the wait staff lovely ordering for takeaway is horrendous as it is always late and cold this is not the restaurants fault but the delivery app uber or just eat if you want a takeout then pick up no problems there the last few times we have eaten in there has been a few issues that were quickly rectified missing fries and drinks however my last visit on the rd my entire main meal was wrong and i ended up with chicken in my pasta i am vegetarian and so i was quite horrified as we are the wait staff who very quickly sorted it out as it was busy i did n t want to make a fuss as the bill came and we were still charged the full amount for the main meal if you have dietary requirements like me then be very clear on your order and double check otherwise the food is super tasty,1,7,8,1,15,0,5.170483995038151
popped in for a quick bite as was on the go there is local free parking nearby and a mins walk over first impressions was disappointing as only food to order machines were working and there was a queue so i went to counter to order instead as i had a fidget baby and just wanted to get seated the staff was busy chatting and did n t look like they wanted to work after standing for a few minutes i finally got served and asked why not use the machines made my order of a chicken wrap meal this was reasonably priced around per meal the food came quick was hot and restaurant was relatively clean but no napkins and there was food amongst the floor the food was ok the wrap was fine but nothing special the chips were over cooked to a crisp and seriously seasoned i ended up throwing these overall i would n t come back again and would n t recommend coming for a visit if was nothing special you could n t get from another competitor,0,9,3,1,7,0,5.214935757608986

was my friends st birthday yesterday his parents booked him a table at cosmos sheffield invited family from portugal and a few close friends we were in total the table was booked well over a month ago when we all arrived at cosmos sheffield the restaurant was near enough empty so many tables available however they sat us all on the sofa bit meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us my friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in out we had no other option to do this meaning that we could n t speak to each others we were so far away from our friends it was basically eat and go home we have travelled from grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them to socialize a bit and that did not happen the children could n t be sat together either due to this my friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables he asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned all he got was a no no no as due to the room layout etc did not offer us a solution at all i mean it is a buffet who would come with such an idea of sofas he tried again explaining how important this dinner was that he ai n t seen his family for a while or us and still there was not a solution and that was it we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone there was more customers complaining for exact same reason a group that was split in just really bad planning we have been customers for so many years cosmos is my favourite restaurant and so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what i have witnessed i think we have all had a change of heart really awful on top of all this they have charged my year old son as an adult and my small year old son almost my friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his id on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise surprise ended up paying for it thr manager was rude and definitely not helpful at all all he wanted was us all sat eating quietly out money and goodbye horrible experience i feel so bad for my friends,0,19,14,1,35,0,6.129050210060545

update they refunded the amount so adjusting the rating appropriately pizza was squashed when it was delivered the coco cola was hot they said they will deliver in mins then it said it was delivered whereas i did n t get it i called them times for them to pick it up and they said the driver picked up orders so that is why there was the error but they delivered after saying they delivered like mins later,0,1,1,0,2,0,4.3694478524670215
the restaurant is very well decorated inside and has a decent atmosphere even on a tuesday night the staff were welcoming and in general the service was great the wine glasses for red wine were not appropriate in my opinion much too small the food was pretty good decent portion sizes and good value the sauces accompanying them complimented the food well so why there is an amount of trust you need to have between a customer and a business and when applying an already large discretionary service charge it should be correct charging over on a bill is not right at all and it should not be the responsibility of the customer to notice this i was told that previous complaints have been made on this and it is a shame it has not been fixed already,0,10,2,0,3,0,4.9344739331306915

used to adore this odeon before it got the luxe upgrade sure the seats are comfy but it is incredibly overpriced and the screens are rather small compared to other cinemas often rather cold in screens and a lack of atmosphere due to hardly anyone going to the cinema also a lack of screens and variety in what they show keep an eye out so often they will advertise a film or have posters up and that film wo n t actually show in the cinema strange staff are nice popcorn is often stale and bland go to the light cinema much much better,0,4,3,0,0,0,4.653960350157523

for such a large space you have a small but delicious buffet selection to be honest i was a little concerned when we went for dinner the buffet service looked pretty small and i wonder how they would cope when full booked thankfully only a handful of happy dinners where in with us despite the limited selection the taste is spot on every dish was unique and you could see the chefs preparing each dish in the open plan kitchen food was replenished almost continuously and thre quality is way ahead of a lot of other buffets the only let down was the desert and single vat of half empty vanilla ice cream and a few portions of fruit on the salad bar so go for the main meals in particular the nepalese hot counter with delicious regional curries best of the best and the other hot plates are yummy too,1,9,2,0,6,0,5.0238805208462765

the pizza here is consistently excellent having visited before i can attest that they never fail to impress the menu offers a variety of gourmet pizzas including vegetarian options although the selection is relatively small i often find myself torn between choices due to the diverse array of high quality ingredients occasionally they feature a special of the day although it not available every day on the dessert front the tiramisu is good though not as standout as the pizza and it on the smaller side while i did n t try the coffee i notice the young server craft a cappuccino for a colleague and it looked quite nice the restaurant is quite small which adds to its charm but may be challenging to find seating especially during weekends i went twice after lunch hour and was never busy,1,7,2,0,5,0,4.948759890378168

this has to have been the worst hotel l have had the misfortune to stay in post covid on arrival l was given a room on the second floor the room was opposite the lift shaft and looked out on a flat roof and the air conditioning units but it was the cleanliness or lack of it l struggled with it was n t the hairs and fluff in the sink or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception but the hairs in the bed at reception l apologised for complaining but said l could n t sleep in a dirty bed after a few visits to the room behind reception the receptionist came back and assigned me a room on the third floor almost directly above the first one i duly moved to be met with a punishment room nowhere to sit work or put any of my toiletries clothes etc that is once l found somewhere to actually be able to open my case however l did n t even get that far due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs photos attached i returned to reception where l found myself apologising again and where the receptionist made it clear she was exasperated with me and basically asked me what l expected her to do with a full hotel i explained that l would be happy just to have the sheets changed eventually this is exactly what happened the bed was changed by one of the other receptionists in the first room so l returned to the second floor where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air the toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working as the others would not flush we had set meal times yesterday evening was supposed to be at hours but we were n t allowed in until hours which messed up a drinks reception due to commence in the bar area at hours all of which had been arranged with the hotel weeks in advance the food itself was n t particularly great especially on the first evening although in fairness lunch on both days was much better to finish it all off this morning a few people found their cars had been broken into windows smashed vehicles damaged overnight in the car park on a more positive note a few of the staff were lovely and helpful,0,23,11,0,11,0,6.0844994130751715

visited while staying in blackpool for nights and pre booked our table a few days in advance for pm arrived on time to be told our table had been taken as a party of had turned up earlier so would be available soon stood waiting for about minutes then table became available waited on by daniel a very friendly helpful staff member who took our order the mushroom al forno starters were lovely and arrived hot our mains lasagne pollo cacciatore were equally as hot and very flavoursome apart from the initial problem upon entrance the visit was very much enjoyed and we would visit again i would recommend to park in the houndshill carpark if driving here as it is situated right next to bella so perfect placement great food and essentially hot update dec visited again while on a xmas break had the mushroom al forno starter again but this time it was a disappointingly smaller portion than in july when we last visited ordered the lasagne as bella is the best but when it arrived it looked horrendous the dish had burn marks all over it and the lasagne itself was as flat as a pancake not acceptable and certainly not the usual quality i receive i called the waitress over karolina could not apologise enough and without excuses took my burnt dish away and minutes later returned again apologised and served me with a fresh hot bubbling and delicious lasange that was much appreciated great service thank you karolina,1,18,3,0,12,0,5.537334267018537
really not a bad place for a quick cheap meal it was clean to standard there was some issues with food under the tables but i am not sure if they only do under the tables so many times a day or we sat down within minutes as the last customers left tye food was fresh and hot and was brought to our table withing minutes lovely staff aswell the blond hair lady which was helping cleaning the trays was a delight to talk to she was honest and made you feel comfortable i will update the next time i am in because she deserves a rise or a extra star i am not sure how you do it but but like i said at the beginning of the review its not a bad place at all thankyou,1,10,2,0,9,0,4.9344739331306915

got a large mixed chicken kebab schwarma tikka tandoori and a schwarma pizza was really looking forward to trying for the first time as i love schwarma was sadly lacking unfortunately chips were under cooked both tikka and tandoori tasted the same and were dry as sticks as was the schwarma which was just flavoured chicken fillets luckily i ordered an extra garlic sauce as none came with the kebab and the salad was basic no cabbage the wrap that came with the kebab was beautiful though pizza was ok but nothing special plus the schwarma had an overwhelming taste of cinnamon which did not go with pizza really disappointed wo n t be going back,0,5,4,1,2,0,4.762173934797756

interesting exhibits for those keen to learn about the history of the local area small museum but space used cleverly to maximise the number of items they can display the caf is good value for a quick small lunch soup and sandwiches seem to be the main lunch items on offer limited seating with it being situated on the mezzanine level so best to either avoid at the height of lunch time or make sure you secure a table before ordering at the busiest times staff are caught up with serving and are distracted so you may have to wait a short while at the counter to order and at the till to pay pleasant gift shop area with a range of goods suited to both children and adults,1,11,4,0,2,0,4.867534450455582

i was so excited to finally visit my first jollibees but honestly it was disappointing the restaurant itself looked really nice clean modern and spacious however it lacked any atmosphere it felt like i was sat in waiting room for the doctors or something i ordered my food on a screen and then went to the collection to which i received zero customer service interaction apart from my number being called out no hello no welcome no thank you the tray with my food just got pushed towards me the spaghetti itself was ok kind of watery and lacked and real taste tempted to go back and try something else but the customer service left me feeling unsatisfied,0,11,5,1,11,0,4.77912349311153
good for offer on cocktails and a small selection of mocktails until we did n t know about this and got there just before and the barman was nice enough to come and tell us we only had a few minutes to get to the bar and make the most of the deal did n t realise until we were there that the majority of the seating area that is available is outside it is sheltered has heaters and throws on the chairs but not really any proper tables to sit at just little side tables to put your drinks on which were a bit unstable inside you will find room for people to dance and two bars one for cocktails and one for spirits beers,1,2,1,0,6,0,4.844187086458591

this is a nice restaurant the staff were friendly and accommodating of my milk allergy the menu is a little reduced at the moment due to what they said was a nationwide issue with hiring staff that being said the food that was still on the menu is up to its usual standard there a limited choice of desserts if you have a milk allergy but they managed to cobble something together that was quite nice for me i recommend the firecracker chicken if you looking for something spicy,1,4,1,0,5,0,4.499809670330265

nicer experience than most supermarkets the aisles are very wide so even when busy it does n t seem like it is fresh fruit and veg at good prices named brands are cheaper than elsewhere but they do less of their own brand products so depending on what you normally purchase it can both increase and decrease your usual cost still a long way to go to compete with the likes of aldi but there is far more variety and it has longer opening hours,1,6,0,0,2,0,4.454347296253507

google maps review for popeyes wembley branch i visited the popeyes branch in wembley to try their breakfast roll combo meal which seems to be a new deal via targeted email marketing this branch restaurant was very quiet and extremely clean during my visit making for a pleasant dining experience friendly staff too quick service all around the meal itself was nice and i have no complaints considering the price point overall i would recommend it for a budget friendly breakfast option but the king of kings mcds muffin will always be the goat along with the hash brown i am going to worth a try,1,7,2,1,5,0,4.672828834461906

we went on a busy saturday evening as a table of terrell was our server and went above and beyond to look after us we were originally sat next to a children party which was a bit loud when we asked terrell if we could move table this was no issue for him and he fulfilled our request despite it being a busy evening he always had a smile on his face and was friendly and kind in regards to the food everything was tasty and the portion size was fair we waited a reasonable time for the food to come out,1,6,1,1,8,0,4.634728988229636
unfortunately this branch has really gone down hill for the amount we paid i expected far better food and service we waited a very long time for food and there were n t many people in there the waitress was kind enough to come over and ask if we were told about the delay which we were n t when they food came the chicken was really dry and bland as though they did n t baste or season it on the grill the garlic bread was rock solid it literally hurt my jaw eating it and gave me a headache we did ask for some of the garlic breads to be replaced but the rest were inedible we are n t complainers so we did n t say anything until we seen the manager at the very end all he said was ok i will let the staff know i think maybe some of the order was ready and was waiting too long before serving which is why everything was dry and almost stale it honestly is not worth the money far too expensive and food very inadequette even the children said how bad it was we wo n t be returning sadly i am writing this in hope you can improve for others because people work hard to treat their families and i would n t want others to walk away with the way we felt,0,11,7,0,18,0,5.476463551931511

having been wanting to try tarragon since it opened i was pleased that it did not disappoint the service was immaculate and the majority of the staff were friendly and helpful although when we arrived i had to offer that we had a reservation overall we all enjoyed the food the english muffin with the chicken liver parfait was unbelievably good but very small the cassoulet with the cod lacked flavour sadly and the crumb was quite wet but the fish was cooked well with some fine tuning this place could be a real gem having said that we will definitely be back and would expect tarragon to continue to rise in popularity,1,9,2,0,6,0,4.736198448394496
excellent afternoon out bowling seven of us including a four year old we really enjoyed the bowling experience there were the occasional pins missing but that just increased our scoring average we found the drinks reasonable but only had onion rings for the little one who enjoyed them the queue at was n t too bad but when we left at on saturday night the queue was nearly out the door it is enjoyable but very busy on a saturday evening,1,5,2,0,5,0,4.406719247264253

this us a very old building with floors staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old on entering there is a bar on either side of the lobby that looks like a furniture shop there was no one at the reception desk as she was chatting tk a bar man next door keys were given in an envelope but nothing else we had to go back down flights of stairs to find out the wi fi code and also when breakfast was served the room was very pretty but was not the one promised we had a view of the kitchen vents ducts which were quite noisy bed very comfortable still and sparkling water and range of teas on tap we were woken by rave music very loud underneath our room that lasted for about minutes on telling reception she informed us that the kitchen does not have a sound system so it could not have been them breakfast room was a rabbit warren away from where we were told three members of staff one being the initial receptionist were there she appeared in the same dress as the day before but with tights that were ripped and laddered over both thighs we sat and waited and then had to ask the youngest young lady if we could have some drinks she was not confident at all and had to ask the other waitress if that was ok no other was taken until we asked the waitress who was busy doing most of the work eventually we had our breakfast and it was good unfortunately others voting in afterwards were not so lucky and had cold tea and coffee served no fruit salad or bowls and long waits for any attention i would not stay again,0,10,5,1,13,0,5.71042701737487

not so great experience here firstly it is cashless which is always frustrating to see in restaurants cafes etc the food was ok but bacon on the pancakes was extremely overcooked and barely edible did n t have much of a taste either on a positive note the staff were friendly and happy to help when there was an issue and the atmosphere is nice especially when seated outside unfortunately the staff take it upon themselves to add their own tip to the bill on the receipt it does state it is an optional service charge though there is no option to remove this tipping should be an optional choice decided by the customer not added on sneakily by staff onto the card machine with no option to change or remove especially in a cashless restaurant where you have no choice but to use card this is pretty irritating,0,8,6,1,1,0,5.0106352940962555

badgers bar restaurant has over google maps reviews and a great star rating so my son and i decided to head here for lunch during our trip to derry londonderry today now i will caveat this by saying that it seemed exceptionally busy for a wednesday lunchtime and in hindsight i wish i would asked what the wait time for food would be i did n t do this and we ended up waiting for around minutes after we would been seated i ordered the badgers beef burger and my son the buttermilk chicken burger both meals come with a side of your choice i got chunky chips my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce the beef burger was nice but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry though a mayo style dip is provided on the side no complaints on the chicken burger from my son the atmosphere in the bar is really nice though and the menu is extensive and well curated with a mix of traditional and contemporary meals and small plates on offer the music playlist was right up my street mostly well known and loved s and early s hits,1,7,2,1,18,0,5.37989735354046

a great place to relax on vacation although the park is not big but it offers a lot more attractions than other british parks can bring fun and satisfaction to tourists except for the most famous tower in the middle it also has a small lake birds often stay in the lake to rest the scenery is very pleasant there are also many very cute squirrels walking around here there is also a bell that has been used before introduced the previous history here but relatively the lack of space and the overcrowded parrots seem very cruel to watch many parrots are constantly chewing off their feathers because they are trapped here they have to live in this poorly lit and crowded space i really do n t recommend it other than that overall this park is very comfortable,1,9,3,0,1,0,4.941642422609304

quite enjoyed my breakfast at hatch it was fresh tasty and made with quality ingredients visited on a weekend so it was very busy and i actually had a short wait for my table however the service was quick and friendly one thing to note is that after taking a glance into the kitchen i could see all the food was being cooked on the same grill eggs sausages etc i point this out because for anyone seeking halal or even vegetarian options the cross contamination is very problematic had i not seen this i would have given hatch a star review,1,3,1,0,7,0,4.634728988229636

update i went to see matilda at pm on the st of december the film was good but felt let down by the quality of the sound was really flat with minimal bass especially on a musical film i paid the extra for the premier seats whilst being a different colour and a slightly higher back they really ai n t comfortable and i was starting to ache so had to keep moving about in my seat to get through the film whilst the seats look good the comfort was n t considered when they were made especially for sitting in for around hours the picture quality was really good with good brightness level i did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when i noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film i really would like to see different straws available as the straws currently just go soggy and collapse around minutes into the film i had and had failed before i finished my large drink i ended up using a spare straw when i got back to my car i had from showcase wich lasted well for the rest of the drink this cinema is good but i would n t use it as my first choice as cinemas are a big part of me and the sound image and comfort are really important things to me for a great cinema experience i do really like the screens outside so you can check the film that is showing before you go in it is a great idea and works well picture taken as i left so shows film time of the showing after the one i watched original i have n t been to a cinema in around years i enjoyed my visit the person serving was friendly and really helpful we got are tickets and drinks we went for the large drinks because hey it is not a regular thing and might aswell go all out on it the person scanning tickets could have been a bit more helpful i rely on things being made clear to me and because i seen the sign for screen one and not screen to as that was around the corner under the stairs it was difficult for me to understand wear it was the the person was friendly it would have been helpful to maby word and explain things a little different as some of us struggle with things like this also maybe move the sign for screen so it can be seen as easy as screen from wear the tickets get checked the cinema was clean tidy and i really enjoyed the film we did notice that about of the way through many the aircon came on or heating went off and started to get cold we will be revisiting soon hopefully i really missed going to the cinema it was a really nice day out with going to the cinema at the end,1,31,6,0,38,0,6.259581464064923
had a great time watching kung fu panda here it is a nice size cinema with decent facilities but the kids wanted drinks and sweets half way through and so found out the tills do n t allow you to pay by card i never carry cash anymore so the person manning the till at the costa kiosk allowed me to pay by card as was n t ordering anything fresh to the actual person who helped me thank you for the flexibility and kindness but i may have ordered popcorn if it was n t for this policy not a major issue but not sure who benefits by the company not allowing a customer to pay by card at a till during a movie there were no queues so this ca n t be a queue reduction technique however on this occasion the company lost out on selling more and i lost out on a snack,1,10,7,1,7,0,5.062595033026967

i am an on and off customer of the past years who thoroughly appreciates the range of milkshakes that this place makes i have tried the milkshakes that other establishments make and for similar prices being charged they really do n t compare in quality to this shop for a basic milkshake in a large cup only amounts to of something to drink however and similar upcharges are a lot more apparent with the other treats on offer so i can only recommend coughing up the money for the milkshakes if you can stomach the price tag,1,2,1,0,4,0,4.584967478670572

my friend and i parked in the bromley sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which i have not visited for years needless to say i did not recognise much after a quick walk and nice lunch we returned to sainsbury which i saw to be a familiar site due to the brand but i realised here too things were very different this is the first time i have ever been to this brach so i got the sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard located the point where i scanned the store location barcode my phone app was up and ready due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere my friend and i picked up some items which i scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out unlike my local sainsburys in essex this sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone in fact i did not come across any hand held scanners in the store if they were there they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store so i queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as i already had prescanned items this just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time after transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode i paid for the shopping we then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode so we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt the person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt how absolutely idiotic so i went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter picture attached there was a person to the left of customer services serving customers tobacco and lottery with baling queue eventually it was my turn and i got the parking ticket stub this i took to my friend who scanned it at the machine we wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher my friend better not get a parking ticket as a store in line with efficiency you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using sainsbury app you should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store also you really need to man the customer services counter and not leave it unattended so many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the tobacco and lottery counter the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers come on management get your thinking cap on,0,15,11,1,45,0,6.343880434126331

we visited the place for the first time and our experience was good but this place is living proof of the saying do n t judge a book by its cover we visited this place minutes after they opened and the place was empty and had a bit of a strange smell but as soon as we got a table our experience changed the service was very kind and polite we ordered an elderflower drink and for starters we had chicken gyozas the gyozas tasted very nice and were crispy and fresh after that we got our ramens we both ordered the tonkotsu ramen and have to say this is the best ramen we have ever had the broth was very tasty the noodles were nice the meat was a bit thin but good and the best part was the boiled egg the best boiled egg i have ever had so flavorful in total we spent around which is reasonable we would definitely visit this place again to try some more food,1,10,2,0,14,0,5.153291594497779
me and partner visited the tim hortons in golden square warrington around today which is a sunday it was our first time at this particular tim hortons i have never been to any tim full stop so this was my first experience when we arrived it was busy but not rammed there was a queue for food collection which was awkwardly set up as there is not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there is a table in the way of collection also so that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which i am adamant does n t work in food places but they keep doing it they could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some mcdonald do but i digress as we would never been we used the self serve to figure out what we would like and the menu were clear and simple but it was so we could go and order in person as i have a blue light card the man said tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that the food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer i got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious thanks to the deal for meals it cost us just under all in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend the low rating for atmosphere was due to the self serve machines and collection point being where they are when people were waiting they all seemed a but stressed we had already eaten the food as it was delicious before thinking to take a picture apologies,1,14,6,0,21,0,5.834810737062605

the architecture of the hotel is amazing lots of construction work on the outside but they were not as noisy as expected the hotel needs a major makeover as everything looks old and the doors are old fashioned and probably repainted times old wall paper in walls the room was very small and not as expected for a double room we booked olivia at the front desk was very friendly and helpful she did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable great outdoor sitting area too with parking on site the hotel has great potential even though southport is known for a more senior majority clientele the location is absolutely amazing in the heart of southport on lord st and short walking distance to kings garden lots of shops around supermarkets coffee shops and restaurants very close to the hotel,1,8,1,0,2,0,4.948759890378168
we had a great time at kailash momo i had been craving chicken momos for quite sometime now and found this gem the food was amazing but there were some disappointments as well the egg chowmein was not at all upto the mark it barely had any egg and the taste was it was bland and was lacking taste and texture jhol momos are momos that are drowned in a bowl full of broth gravy the broth is supposed to be spicy but sadly at this place it was not the texture was grainy and did not feel good in the mouth other dishes such as chilly paneer chicken steamed momos and chicken fried rice was bang on one weird thing there was a really tiny pebble we call it kankar when i took my first bite of the fried rice but other than that the taste of the fried rice was really nice i would love to go to this place again to try their thaali and fried momos majority of the people there were ordering the thaali so can not wait to be there again also highly recommend to have a reservation before hand or else it super difficult to get a table,1,9,5,0,6,0,5.327876168789581

drive through ordered mighty bucket for one and hoping for anything other than chicken legs but got then to my disbelief i received hot wings but looked like they had been stripped of all chicken then breaded and recooked times both of them chicken strips and gravy were ok but the chicken strips look like they have shrunk too absolutely appalling food standards and they are literally robbing the public blind,0,4,2,0,2,0,4.276666119016055

the food was very nice service was good clean toilet facilities top of stairs food was served quickly my wife and i really enjoyed coco mill only a couple of things that need tweaking it is understandable that such a popular place has a large roll over of customers as the night goes on so i guess this can be looked at as a positive and a negative view point it is the been told you only have half an hr left at your table and then kind of felt we are being forced out and having a staff member settling your bill on their terms i get it and see they are thinking about new customers ect so it feels like ok your done guy now move on maybe ask the customer if they would like to move to a cosy area as they will need our table and we would have most likely had a couple of extra drinks if this approach was implemented,1,11,2,0,11,0,5.117993812416755
very busy and had a nice atmosphere we managed to get a table within minutes which was lovely service was impeccable everyone so so so lovely the menu was amazing so varied and unique pieces however the food was n t the best which is a shame it obviously all personal preference but for me and the people i went with we were n t a fan which is really upsetting because of how good the menu is so we probably wo n t return,1,7,2,0,5,0,4.454347296253507

a rather disappointing bank holiday lunch although there was a good selection of vegetables the chef carving the meat appeared to have the world sharpest knife one would have expected at least one decent slice of meat and a couple of smaller slices i chose only turkey however despite there being well over half the turkey on display with lots of meat he literally shaved five slivers off the base when we last visited lincoln we had a couple of generous slices sadly when i mentioned this he replied it now on weight that fine i understand the business has to make a profit overheads are a killer but he did not weigh anything and just guessed at what he was serving up our group of four were all shocked as to the amount we received so it was not just myself on top of that the restaurant was very quiet with only a handful of filled tables we sat for nearly half an hour after finishing our meals before the waitress came to our table again had they been busy serving lots of tables this would have been acceptable but that was not the case i do n t know whether this review reflects all toby carvery restaurants or whether this is just applicable to lincoln but we wo n t be in a hurry to return to toby carvery when there are so many eating establishment that offer true value for money,0,10,4,0,12,0,5.501258210544727

overall mid way commercial cinema experience between the everyman and the odeon good for wimbledon which let face it that despite best efforts is pretty run down and soulless i think i speak with reasonable authority having been born and raised in sw and seen the downward decline in the name of modernisation over the last years expect conventional but reasonably comfortable seats on a slight incline to allow good viewing you not going to get the luxurious sofa with little tables and high quality seat service like the everyman but you are a cut above the boring odeon chain you feel like you part of something in the middle you are food nice selection of snacks what i liked per ticket non member rate reasonable food and drink offering colour themed screens friendly staff the have special screenings adapted for those with different requirements good value membership schemes for cinema aficionados what i did n t like over priced popcorn no one actually checked our tickets on entry so could easily have walked straight in conversely this makes me question the security not quite enough of an incline on the seating meaning it was a stretch most of the time to look over peoples heads to read the subtitles do i recommend going yes will i go again yes was it good value price point,1,24,3,1,13,0,5.424950017481403

occupying an imposing corner plot near to drypool bridge they serve a good range of ales as well as the usual drinks main bar area at the front and then follows a large seating area with big tvs playing the daily sports events we would booked a table for food and was n t disappointed with the tasty hull pies with chips mash peas and gravy it can get quite noisy with those watching the tv but it is worth a visit not a great deal of parking nearby only on the street and pay display,1,5,4,0,1,0,4.574710978503383
i like to preface this by saying i had an incredible time at the night and previously at the frank sinatra gig performed by the same great people however there were people who bought tickets for their family as they were assured through someone higher up that under s were allowed and once they got there any underage people were kicked out despite it being a very family friendly event if this was because it was an event open to the public let me turn that around and mention the fact that bar staff were not informed that tickets were open to the public and instead when asked about what the event was were told it a private party the lack of marketing for this event compared to others was shocking and the fact the people running it rang to check if under s were allowed multiple times and they were then turned away was abysmal for an event this quality with such an intricate amount of attention on detail and organisation it was disappointing they were treated like this,0,7,3,0,3,0,5.198497031265826
had a works christmas do here the place was busy friday evening we waited to be seated upstairs down stairs the bar was heaving every table was full when we went upstairs they put on very large table next to the stage the band was great got up cheering singing and dancing the sazzaphone player was good add on to the band to the food was great the service was just bit to long but considering how busy it was understandable,1,4,0,0,2,0,4.406719247264253

no toilet roll in barthroom no soap lucky has thease with me just been shoping no cutlery or napkins and none in the entire store no plate or tray just back to basic here barbarian style there is cost cutting and going too far not as clean as it could be toilets were clean and fresh but need to bring your own toilet roll and soap i am sure this is a breach of health and safty rule and is an instant fail on your hygiene rating if inspection finds this,0,5,6,1,4,0,4.5217885770490405
what a great venue for a gig we went to watch the zutons here situated in what looks like an old trading yard it is got a funky carribbean vibe with a great outdoor area for some fantastic street food and seating a few indoor booths for keeping the rain off a tidy venue for live music and i hope it keeps getting well supported to keep live music alive beer was priced fairly with reds stripe at a pint the staff were really friendly the bouncers could do with some improvement they came across as arrogant and a little aggressive if you do n t expect the ritz and expect a funky friendly carribbean live music and street food venue then you wo n t go wrong thanks for a top night,1,13,5,0,4,0,4.897839799950911
went for some xmas cheers and all in all was a lovely day for the family got in early and was quiet however was very busy towards the evening plenty on offer food and drink wise with some festive offerings for the fun seekers winter wonderland far better than the castle area i am going to be warned though take lots of cash with you as it is what it is at this time of year but some things are mega expensive and wrongly priced its a once a year visit for us though and we all enjoyed the day very much,1,7,1,0,4,0,4.634728988229636

not impressed went here for a works christmas party the food was very mediocre i have tasted better soup from a tin the turkey was thin like mass processed stuff and the service was horrendously slow we were seated by pm serving started around an hour later and our deserts finally arrived at the portion sizes were so small that many of us ended out getting pizza from pizza express across the road,0,4,1,0,4,0,4.30406509320417

came in for an early sunday lunch and was n t busy at all may be because of the weather as was quiet freezy and wet outside it got busier later on though so luck of atmosphere at first an was quiet cold inside too heaters off mind you the guy on shift did compensate it all very pleasant helpful and more important positive and professional well done food was good rump steak well cooked and tasty hunters chicken not too bad would say a bit dry only issue the onion rings on different dishes here can definitely improve would n t recommend them prices are the cheapest i have seen around wow all in all good town pub great if the staff are all the same,1,14,1,0,2,0,4.852030263919617

one of many ideal watering holes to visit on game day for southend utd located within proximity of the ground the pub offers a large public bar and outside space at the rear friendly and very efficient staff with the ability to serve you without much delay the pub is dated throughout but this should not put you off as it is made up for by a friendly welcome and good pub management,1,7,1,0,2,0,4.30406509320417

the food was amazing the service was excellent and the music so inviting however we waited hr and to be seated and another hour and min to get the food while the management could do better the whole experience was great when we left people were still waiting to be seated i suppose that when the food just touches your soul and its so affordable it does n t matter that it is takes a while to reach your table the wait is worth it,1,6,0,0,5,0,4.454347296253507
i love these arches and on here it is classed as a tourist attraction which it should be it is lovely cobbled path lots of history lovely to look at however at the moment each arch homes homeless people so it seems a bit unfair to now call it a tourist attraction no one wants to see that and the homeless people do n t really warrant being called a tourist attraction,0,6,2,1,1,0,4.290459441148391
went in the day time it was quite quiet staff are friendly and helpful lots of arcade games and pool tables are there too accessible toilets all on one level so good for wheelchairs reasonable drinks a choca mocha cost i did n t have any food lots of seating with tables some were quite private also there was a bar serving alcohol along with the food and hot and cold drinks,1,3,0,0,1,0,4.290459441148391

i have to say we had a fantastic time at the ivy for friendsmas the customer service was sensitive and perceptive the food is consistently perfect i attended the previous day too for my sister birthday but the salmon was not available positively i was able to eat the salmon at friendsmas it was worth the wait it is the ivy attention to detail that remains second to none we had christmas crackers and a wonderful booth for our meal together the had the ice cream dessert which came with generous sized biscuits i could have ordered two the only down side was the fact that the restaurant was quite busy due to the time of year towards the end we were slightly rushed as there was another booking i wished there was more space in the venue to relax after eating we would have spent more had there been space to lounge however space is often a luxury i will forever rate the ivy good and service top tier,1,9,0,0,12,0,5.14166355650266
this was my st visit to madame tussauds in blackpool really enjoyed seeing all the wax models of well known famous people lady ga ga blowing a kiss was great although a bit scary at first the roller coaster ride was awesome followed by the less scary ghost train ride i felt though there were a couple or so wax models that did n t look an exact lookalike to the real people portrayed but still enjoyed the visit well worth it it took us about an hour a half to go round including my rides which were totally awesome will definitely go again,1,10,3,0,4,0,4.653960350157523

were a few things i did n t understand and i think it is very unnecessary first of all the security guards who met you at the door take you through the passport check in as if they are taking you through the bag check in the top search check in the ticket check out and the water you have on you they decoy you to security in detail so this security is too much of an exaggeration because we are going to enter a roller coaster on the bottom another issue that i am uncomfortable with is that sometimes on the roller rink we stepped aside to take a breath and relax i was n t even allowed to take a photo with my friend we were standing in a place where we would n t disturb anyone the skating officials inside told us to get off the rink to relax was it worth getting off the rink for a minute it is really ridiculous the staff inside are very respectful and very in love with their work people standing at the door motivated us very much with the style of the cloakroom gentleman and his smiling face another employee inside the portuguese bartender lady is also smiling with patience and i really like that she does her job with love thank you very much,0,16,3,0,19,0,5.424950017481403

buried away down shuttle paisley arts centre is this busy venue genres of music are featured regularly tonight it was blues rock by the newly formed davey pattison band the venue is a windowless low roofed structure with a great stage with superb lighting it has a sixties type club feel to it and still has a charge tonight was a ticketed concert and was sold out there were expectations as this was davey first home concert in some time the mainly elderly crowd were not disappointed,1,2,2,0,0,0,4.477336814478207

a very easy option if you have people with varying tastes no need to book although you can if you want to be sure the carvery choice was good and the mash potato and roast potatoes were delicious outside seating next to a large open green space quite a walk from the carpark round the back to the entrance so you might want to drop off anyone with limited mobility before parking,1,6,3,1,4,0,4.290459441148391

awesome food with some great varieties impressed by the portion size massive portions for the mains we took rajastani daal and dill and spinach chicken it was deliciously tasty we took aloo tikki chat bigger portion could have been a good idea there and would have preferred a flat presentation rather than the small bowl which was difficult to eat service was good especially enjoyed the special request they fulfilled for pickle and onion to go with the food surprised to see it was charged though when we saw the bill would certainly recommend for the great tasting food and big portion sizes overall,1,13,2,0,3,0,4.653960350157523

very dark in this establishment could just be the overall vibe they are trying to achieve service was decent but i feel like we waited a long time for our orders to be taken the wagyu bao buns were amazing it is a shame that the starter was better than the main moving onto the mains black angus steak i believe and chicken something ca n t remember the name will link pictures the steak was very salty and the peppercorn sauce made me feel kind of sick never had this problem before with any other shop the chicken dish was amazing and i had no problems with the flavours temperature etc whatsoever the steak really let me down overall on the food some members of staff were very over the top forcing the sir madam and i felt like they were programmed to be a hospitable robot another waiter who is name i ca n t remember was genuinely nice and so was the young lady at the front of house,1,8,5,1,9,0,5.153291594497779
we ordered the breakfast offer breakfast with a drink it is filling and tasty and we prefer that to the doughnuts we believe the seating area can be improved with regards to the temperature it is a bit too warm better seats and accessibility you ca n t bring a stroller or a wheelchair upstairs as there is no lift staff are helpful and nice,1,5,1,1,4,0,4.189654742026425

goresbrook park children play area recently gone through refurbishment and new play equipments and surface were installed much better than the the state it was before thanks to the local authority to redo this play area however i am really disappointed to see that there is not a single accessible play equipment it was redone only months before local authority should have added accessible play equipments for vulnerable and disabled children there are plenty of play equipments that are being built for disabled children barking dagenham council needs to look into this and install accessible play equipments in the existing play areas along with dedicated accessible play area in order to increase the outdoor access to vulnerable and disabled children play area is an essential and integral part of development of all the children,0,16,3,0,1,0,4.90527477843843

good value cinema with a pizza restaurant next door with pizza and cinema ticket deals good value the staff were very friendly found the popcorn drinks and sweets are expensive and similar to big chain prices but i guess that is where the money is made especially when the tickets are just without a movie magic card so the actual film is excellent value the seats are basic but comfortable enough for a new cinema with plenty of legroom just wish they would recline but nice to support a local cinema over a big chain and would certainly visit again when in torquay,1,13,0,0,1,0,4.6443908991413725

arriving at the ivy asia on a wet manchester evening was a bit bemused at the refusal by staff to accept the collapsible umbrella in case they lost it well do n t lose it then so we dine with a wet umbrella the decor is stunning the food really good but the service sadly lacking did n t appreciate our server breaking off to talk to another member of staff whilst we were ordering decided to go for small plates all of which arrived in good time and were delicious no complaints whatsoever there but after that no one was interested in us seemed that most not all of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners friends local celebrity the restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service decided against a dessert and figured it would be too much trouble to get a coffee so we paid and left wo n t go back shame really because the food and the restaurant itself are great back to the tattu next time methinks,0,12,8,1,5,0,5.25227342804663

as food chains go this one is beautifully designed perfectly located and well staffed on entrance we were greeted by a very enthusiastic member of staff in a very americanised manner over excited and loud but and it a big but she was nice and polite we were ushered to our table and directed to use the qr code to order our food now we have two points of view about this visit my son said he would have preferred the personal touch the more human approach and did not enjoy the experience of not ordering directly to a real person i on the other hand can kind of understand what he meant but was ok with the way i ordered the food i scanned the qr code and ordered and paid for the food via apple pay the food arrived quite quickly and was as ordered my son again complained that he would have liked someone to tell him where the plates and sauces were so in a matter of minutes we had three members of staff including the manager asks us if everything was ok being british it felt a bit much but actually they were very polite the food was as always was consistent so chicken is chicken not much to talk about here the restaurant is very modern and spacious and there was a mixture of age groups and families eating in the decor is well designed and interesting they have plenty of space inside and outside under parasols but today it was raining and a bit cold so no one outside it located in a partly pedestrianised area and parking is difficult all in all great place professional staff and good food,1,17,4,1,12,0,5.662960480135946
pretty poor service i am not surprised no one was there walked in to a empty venue after been greeted at the door we was given menu between two of us and said just sit where ever not a good start once we sat down i decided to get my own menu as we was n t given two poor waiting for table service which never came i saw a lady doing some sweeping after trying to get her attention quite loudly i found out she had airpods in not good once she decided to not ignore us anymore she told us to go to the counter to order which we was never told at the begging we had to shout through a thick plastic barrier we are not in covid any more no need for a sound proof barrier anymore and once we had ordered they forgot our water wo n t be going back not surprised it was empty food was alright but overshadowed by the poor customer experience staff training needed,0,7,10,1,16,0,5.1647859739235145

as a christmas gift my wife and i went for an afternoon tea this is something we do every year and we try out the different ones around tunbridge wells sadly this did not live up to expectations when we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in we waited there for around minutes before being seen to nobody else was there one person walked by and said they would be back but we did n t see them again when we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day we got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so i asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our afternoon tea when our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it one of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted if we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes the sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry the scones i do n t think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n t risen they tasted ok but quite dense we used up the cream and jam with the first scones so we asked if we could have some more when it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell we tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n t quite right when we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef we did n t hear what their opinion was on the whole i say it was all round a poor experience with the status this hotel has i definitely expected more there are other local afternoon teas that blow this out of the water,0,13,6,0,33,0,5.948034989180646

my first visit arranged by my daughter popular and booking was essential for tables inside and out as the weather was good we would booked a table for outside there was a live dj which although fabulous was a notch or two too loud we struggled to converse and the staff kept asking us to repeat our orders we moved table twice with consent of staff to support my hearing loss this helped us immensely the staff were helpful and checked in regularly to ensure we had everything we needed the selection of drinks were good as was the food the facilities were good and clean although they were upstairs there was an accessible toilet outside too we spent a few very enjoyable hours here the atmosphere was perfect for celebrating on this occasion,1,13,2,0,12,0,4.90527477843843

busy little coffee shop with solid breakfast selections we went with the salmon and bacon eggs benedict with extra side of sausages perfectly poached eggs without the yucky translucent bits good tangy hollandaise sauce and crusty bread just a minor comment we ordered more sausages but the second time it came not pan fried to a nice brown crisp color looked quite pale best to book in advance otherwise be prepared to wait in line especially on a weekend,1,6,1,0,2,0,4.382026634673881
was very busy but we did n t have to wait for a table probably because there was only of us there was background music but was drowned out by everyone talking loudly staff were polite and diligent and the food seemed freshly cooked which is always a bonus these days parking is limited but plenty of taxis would n t say it was wheelchair friendly good selection of drinks and not overpriced in my opinion,1,3,2,0,3,0,4.343805421853684

i have n t been to harvester in seven years when i got pregnant with my son i hated the thought of the place due to pregnancy i have really wanted to go again for awhile so we visited harvester in west brom it is on the pricey side in my opinion i would recommend you do not get the steak unless you want a steak you can not eat because it so tough the chicken was fine and had a little spice to it which i loved the customer service is very slow i did feel a little uncomfortable in there,0,4,3,0,13,0,4.634728988229636

delicious pistachio and raspberry cake and good pistachio latte lacking pistachio flavour in the latte though we had to wait around mins to be seated which i think is reasonable however there were lots of seaters with only people on them it might be a good idea to have x tables pushed together rather than seaters so they can be pulled apart to accommodate people would recommend staff were very friendly too and prices reasonable,1,5,0,0,2,0,4.330733340286331

the food is good and the prices are okay do n t get me wrong i always loved coming here me and my brother food is delicious but tonight is the night where it has put me off it i went in to collect my order and there was a new staff there she was extremely rude to another customer she was serving and extremely rude to myself she demanded for the customer she was serving to get out of the way to ask me what my order is just because his wife asked him to order something else and i said just let him go first and with a rude attitude and face she demanded for me to get here and push the other customer out of the way that was so rude of her it has really put me off going if this is the attitude they will have she then threw the card machine on the side and nearly fell off hats off to the other staff they polite,0,4,7,0,12,0,5.153291594497779

i went to a roman bath last sunday and it was really cool the place was full of history there were big pools of warm water just like the romans used to have the building itself was old and beautiful with lots of fancy pillars and statues it felt like stepping back in time they also had these interesting displays with artifacts and information about how the romans lived i learned a lot about their daily routines and traditions one thing to keep in mind is that it can get pretty crowded especially on weekends so it is a good idea to go early if you want to avoid the crowds overall i had a great time at the roman bath it is a must visit if you are interested in history and want to experience a piece of ancient roman life,1,12,1,0,5,0,4.962844630259907

at mr singh all vegetarian restaurant takeaway vegetarians are treated to a delightful selection of meat free alternatives that rival their carnivorous counterparts from hot dogs to chicken burgers tandoori chicken style pizzas and delicious french fries mr singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes the four star rating i have given is largely attributed to the standout dish the chilli paneer pizza which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite which in my opinion is the highlight of mr singh menu while the food impresses the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch the d cor and furnishings appear dated detracting slightly from the overall dining experience for those choosing to dine in restaurant the service is satisfactory but could be more attentive to elevate the dining experience further as far as beverages go unfortunately the milkshakes leave something to be desired lacking the thick creamy texture that milkshake aficionados crave in conclusion mr singh offers a vegetarian haven for those seeking flavorful meat free options while there are areas for improvement such as updating the ambiance and refining the milkshake offerings the delicious food makes it a worthwhile dining destination for vegetarians and meat eaters alike i go as far as saying in terms of takeaway pizzas it possibly up there as one of the best in the midlands surrounding areas,1,14,2,0,3,0,5.459585514144159

i thoroughly enjoyed the food the haddock and chips were of great quality and well complimented by the mushy peas as well as this we ordered the cheesecake of the day which we were told was oreo cheesecake however what we got tasted more like chocolate caramel or millionaire cheesecake either way the cheesecake to top it off was great quality however the missus thought the chips were a bit hard and was disappointed that the oreo cheesecake did n t exist even though she happily munched and enjoyed the caramel cheesecake so because she the boss the food only recieved stars,1,10,2,0,4,0,4.634728988229636

went for an early dinner during the week the thing that immediately hits you is the cleanliness which is incredibly high people are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters we ordered from a menu in chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food despite the reputation of the sichuan region of china i must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way one is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in china but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate food is actually abundant well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in i recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon,1,7,4,0,8,0,5.017279836814924

update have been a few times now and the food has n t been up scratch there is always something missing in one of our meals latest one was ordering an ultimate burger which was missing the bacon went to the white sawn for lunch had to get past people smoking right outside the door once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table we ordered from the app the drinks and food arrived promptly after the pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate it was generously topped as well and tasted good the fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes the only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance maybe they should move the smoking area,0,9,3,0,5,0,5.159055299214529

the food was amazing the flavors blended nicely and they were good sized portions the kingston chicken was impeccable with a crunchy outer layer yet moist and well cooked inside it was well seasoned and we would order it again for sure we also recommend the jerk wings very flavorful and the jerk sauce complimented them nicely the last thing we had was the shrimp and potato curry with rice it was rich and flavorful not too heavy at all and well garnished the only downside was that our service was not good as they never came to check on us unless we waved somebody down which even that took awhile other than that the food was amazing,1,13,3,0,6,0,4.77912349311153
well it was my first time eating here and what can i say the food was absolutely gorgeous so flavorful and definitely hot the only thing that let it down was dessert portion sizes but besides that it was spectacular the atmosphere was warm and buzzing with life and the server had a constant smile and polite attitude would highly recommend,1,6,0,0,2,0,4.127134385045092
the manager was excellent in helping me to navigate what i could eat coeliac on their menu i heard him tell the chefs too which reassured me my daughter enjoyed her child meal of chicken wings and the quantity was bigger than i thought for the price my only negative is the price i paid for what was essentially a small piece of chicken chip spice chips and a small coleslaw there are no gf bred options,1,4,2,1,8,0,4.356708826689592
i had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night when i went to order at the counter the staff told me to use the self service kiosks instead while i understand they are promoting this new technology the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach i did n t receive a paper receipt at the end after waiting minutes to receive my food i noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food keeping food warm in the fry station multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards while most of the staff seemed totally lost only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing i do n t know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station i left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions poor service and difficult technology i hope burger king can work out these kinks because i believe there is an opportunity to improve,0,8,6,0,12,0,5.25227342804663

visited twice once sunday night and then for a lovely cooked vegan friendly breakfast busy sunday night the bar team was n t very aware of who was next at the bar leaving me waiting a while to be served while others jumped in and my drink had to be repoured as the lemonade syrup had gone but once i got their attention and they helped me they were really friendly and kind my partner went to the bar to order breakfast so i did n t have any interaction with the bar team monday morning but the food was delicious and absolutely incredible value for money love their vegan cooked breakfasts i do get extra mushrooms tomatoes and a hashbrown as it is not quite big enough for a treat day breakfast but amazing value all the same toilets are downstairs by the way for anyone visiting i asked a possible regular where they were and he was super friendly pointing me in the right direction,1,12,0,0,9,0,5.123963979403259

a nice setting and well varied menu service was n t the best however had to ask a couple of times for drinks and at one stage all the staff were standing behind the bar all texting on their mobiles whilst we were sat trying to get their attention to order had the black pepper lamb main course was n t nice at all of course due to the description of the dish i expected it to have a prominent black pepper flavour which i like however it tasted like a bucket of black pepper had been dropped into the pan,0,7,0,0,3,0,4.624972813284271
had a lovely dinner at wall wall last night the food was really good with lots of flavour and they had a very large menu so something for everyone price was mid range i had small plates which came to around so slightly on the pricier side but the currys were better value it was just a shame about the service the two waiters we had did n t seem to want to be there and the bill took a while to come and our plates were n t even cleared and the restaurant was very quiet we would recommend going for the food but would have been nice to have happier waiters,1,9,1,0,4,0,4.736198448394496

it was great but why not stars food star taken away for kebab that was hanging dry i think it because of batch cooking and having to serve hanging kebabs and burgers for at more or less the same time coleslaw looked like it been out a while more importantly for the price it not all that your local kebab shop would taste better i sure other than that the calamari was good burgers were good pie of the day was good nothing outstanding but not too shabby service they tried their best but the place was heaving on a saturday night servers were brilliant star taken away due to the super long gap between starters and main meal considering they were pushing us to have our starters good vibe it a place where one has to shout at another to be heard drinks these are lovely costly but lovely nonetheless we had some the blackberry and rhubard cooler was a fave not so the botanist lemonade overall it stars so not bad,1,16,2,0,6,0,5.159055299214529

ahoy there fellow breakfast adventurers avocado toast enthusiasts rejoice gail bakery is a curious nook in altrincham town center that will have you hooked and wanting to come back for more the avocado toast was the stuff of legends sending my taste buds on a rollercoaster ride of delight but wait it gets better the secret weapon was the mysterious and alluring salsa verde sauce served on the side like a daring sidekick ready to take on any culinary challenge speaking of challenges i faced the flat white quest next it was acceptable though it lacked a bit of magic still it played well with the avocado toast so we will call it a breakfast truce now time to unravel the bagel enigma the bagel ceremoniously crowned with a luscious blend of jam and butter whispered sweet nothings into my taste receptors oh how it charmed my senses the space inside the bakery is a cozy hug think of it as breakfast in a warm embrace however if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats you will have to roll the dice with the weather outdoor seating is a fair weather friend but when it cooperates it is a treat attention parents mini humans are welcome here the vibe is kid friendly and it is a decent spot to enjoy breakfast with your little ones as long as it is not peak hour madness to sum it all up gail bakery is like an enchanted breakfast nook that sprinkles a dash of quirkiness into your morning routine grab your avocado toast dance with the salsa verda and embark on a breakfast adventure just make sure to check the weather forecast before you set sail to claim the coveted outdoor seats bon app tit,1,29,2,0,13,0,5.697093486505405

our inaugural visit to the cafe in wakefield city center unfolded as a pleasant surprise marked by affordability and hearty portions although the name eludes my memory the overall experience left a lasting impression the cafe proved to be a budget friendly haven offering a range of options without denting the wallet we opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank the portions were generous a welcome sight for voracious appetites the burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration the affordability to portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience the first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare while the flavors were commendable the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration despite the minor crispiness setback the food resonated well with my hunger stricken state the savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect ensuring an enjoyable meal it is a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price regrettably the cafe name escapes my recollection hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in wakefield city center the overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits a hidden gem indeed awaiting a more memorable encore wakefieldcafeexperience affordableeats,1,24,6,0,6,0,5.541263545158426

no really what i expected from a burger who are they kidding comparable to we spent for x cheese burger and x fries what a joke the burger van at princes square during the week does a much better job for less disappointed nothing against the staff is the overall food experience that does n t match with the burgers advertised on their boards never again thanx,0,3,2,1,2,0,4.219507705176107
nice place if you want to get the casino experience they have all types of games from slot machines to black jack tables staff is nice and ambience is good it feels safe unlike some other dingy casinos they used to have a program where you can get two free chips to use in the casino if you sign up for receiving promotional emails however that has been discontinued post covid,1,6,0,0,3,0,4.276666119016055

should call this place the tardis because what you see on the outside is n t what you get on the inside if it was n t a wetherspoons i would n t have gone in from the outside view but once your in it is spacious with lots of wood panelling beautiful rooms upstairs and nice atmosphere it has an outside area in the middle of the building which i was amazed it had more importantly the staff were friendly and efficient one of the places you should definitely not judge a book by it is cover your shopping in barnsley well worth a visit,1,9,0,0,7,0,4.672828834461906

arrived at friday very busy night ordered food and drinks at the bar no queueing get your table number before ordering food choice of cask ale unlike so many large pubs going over to cider happy days if you like cider food came in good time chicken jalfrezi curry rice soft naan crispy poppadums plus chicken with a dip and chips chips could have been warmer but that was the only snag the same eating experience could be had by visiting the ready meal section of a supermarket heating it up at home with your own choice of music tv you still have to wash up it is less fun and cask ale tastes far better than cans or bottles drinks ordered on the app came super quick overall it was a happy night for us amber rooms is a big place and we were lucky to get a seat very popular with students curry plus a pint on a friday and many scrumy snack choices for under why would n t it be next time we are feeling like being sociable eating out but not spending a king ransom,1,15,1,1,7,0,5.25227342804663

love the place not cheap however but the food tasty and a decent portion considering it can be quite rich unfortunately sat downstairs at our last visit which does n t h gave quite the same atmosphere as a smaller room and more brightly lit although it is quieter so easier to converse we also went for a couple of the set pieces and with a table for there was very little room for the elaborate but sizeable presentation pieces and so some of the effect lost as we had to clear stand on their arrival in order to accommodate the dishes upstairs on a previous visit we had a rectangular table that afforded more table space which was better dishes nicely cooked and very tasty and will definitely be back,1,8,2,0,4,0,4.882801922586371
quick delivery which may explain why the vegetable yakisoba was just noodles and carrots dry and lacked any flavour first and very likely the last time getting food from here very disappointing we did ring to try and rectify but no answer and had to leave a voicemail,0,0,3,1,1,0,3.8918202981106265
it was a lovely place to visit it was a bit of a shame that the river was so high following the torrential rain that had recently happened meaning that you were not able to see the full extent of just how the river looks normally it just means i will have to go back another time,1,1,1,0,2,0,4.060443010546419
being ordering from here for the last years and recently this place has been going very down hill wait times have massively increased my last order i was waiting hours food quality is also down hill my most recent order the pizza was very burnt and charging for stuffed crust when they might have well as not put cheese in it with the amount they used definitely not worth it upsetting that they cooked my pizza looked at it and decided that this is the quality they want to serve i also had plenty of cold food lately it a shame because when they get it right the food is amazing but they just are n t getting it right enough lately i be looking for a new regular takeaway,0,6,2,0,6,0,4.875197323201151

it is nice to have something like this so close to home a variety of games to partake in and the console booths are always fun staff are friendly and attentive and will always have a quick conversation they are also more than happy to help with anything you need to know about the games on offer not eaten here yet so i ca n t comment on that but i plan to the drinks are varied and well priced i can personally recommend the sunday fizz cocktail croissant flavoured vodka and prosecco with a chunk of croissant covered in strawberry jam,1,8,0,0,4,0,4.634728988229636
at the moment during january entry is free but of course they appreciate voluntary donations which you can do by card or cash they do offer free guided tours or you can have an audio guide but that waffles on a bit we were lucky to meet one of the guides with free time and he was interesting the original part was built in norman times and the rest was added there are numerous memorials with a high proportion of devon soldiers numerous historic items can be found with the original mechanics of the large clock above the gift shop on view the organ pipes are enormous being over mtrs tall well worth a visit for only the next couple of days there is a light show on in the evenings,1,11,0,0,3,0,4.882801922586371

we came for lunch and enjoyed the food we ordered everything was hot and tasted fresh the only downside is the cost of drinks nearly for a glass of coke i understand it is bottomless but not everyone wants more than one glass there should be a cheaper option for a smaller drink but this is obviously a corporate decision and does not reflect the individual nando overall we enjoyed our meal and would return,1,3,1,0,5,0,4.330733340286331

really disappointed after visiting on saturday morning the reception team were n t particularly welcoming and it seemed to be an inconvenience for us to be there we paid for tickets and without rushing we saw everything in just minutes sure it is colourful and there are some interesting exhibits but such a quick visit is very disappointing for the cost of the ticket the staff dotted around seemed passionate and knowledgeable it is just a shame there is n t really a lot to keep you engaged,0,5,4,0,4,0,4.48863636973214

nice spoons to have a quick pint in on our first leg of a journey to somerset staff were friendly and quick to serve a good job as the parking outside is limited to minutes multi storey car park close by but as we have a van the height restriction meant we could n t access this if like me you love wetherspoons this is a nice one to tick off your list,1,6,2,0,6,0,4.30406509320417

a nice comfortable chilled out place near albany park it is usually pretty quiet during the day but the evenings can get more lively with different events and entertainment in the main hall there is nice food and drink on offer which is reasonably priced and it is also nicely decorated you can also hire out parts of the building for your own parties and celebrations there are also a few parking spaces available around the outside of the building and disabled access,1,8,0,0,2,0,4.430816798843313
out to eat with a friend saw the this place and thought we would gamble it with the bad reviews sadly it lived up to them order was taken quick enough but the clerk did n t seem to have much knowledge or advice about the menu took a while for the food to be prepared so i would n t call this fast food in anyway food did n t look all that appealing but it is all about the flavours which are bland the nachos did n t have much sour cream on thus thought we could ask for more and that became an issue as it was good enough as far as the staff were concerned i would say go for the novelty aspect but i doubt you will return,0,3,3,0,6,0,4.897839799950911

it overpriced for what you actually get i i ordered garlic mushrooms with cheese which i thought they would be breaded mushrooms because that what most takeaways sell also who would want mushrooms fried with cheese poured over and who would want to sell that if you own a takeaway or a food place you would n t want to sell horrible food also it add on here but got there there was a sticker over the price and they wrote also i got some cookie dough what was meant to be they charge and i got banana waffle what was more expensive than it says on here as well i paid for all this and none of it was worth it the waffle taste like that horrible taste ovens have when you do n t clean a burnt taste and the only reason i ordered this food is because it did n t have the food what i wanted they said they did n t sell that anymore so most of the things on the menu what you see on google they do n t really sell and the only reason i go there because there open around mine but i wo n t be going there again i fuming i have to pay for crap i did n t eat i thought there no point asking for my money back as they are sometimes very rude and you give me a fake for change i would n t go there unless you are starving and you have no other options also i want to add when i got the food it was stapled show the bag it was like they did n t want me to look in it until i got home no i know why i want to give me the fake fiver they did n t give me the real fiver back by the way,0,11,12,1,34,0,5.771441123130016

i had read the reviews beforehand and the bad ones seems to be more about the service than the food i thought i would still support the venture and try it but i really should have stayed away the food was not great at all i ordered curry chicken with white rice salad and coleslaw the rice was extremely dry as if it had been burnt left out for ages on the side the potatoes in the curry were barely cooked and the chicken was mediocre i asked for fresh rice and it was just as bad i did n t finish my meal and left hungry the coleslaw was good though service was average nice guys but slow service not quite sure why the establishment was playing r kelly either definitely wo n t be coming back,0,8,2,0,8,0,4.9344739331306915
sensational food service and evening out with my go karting team will definitely return to the good earth it totally deserves stars the only reason i did n t give is that it is pricy when almost all of the dishes are over and averaging it adds up i had the sweetcorn soup vegetarian chicken sechuan veggie singapore noodles and the rest of the table had a plethora of meat dishes,1,2,0,0,3,0,4.276666119016055

the pub is lovely and the service as well so it such a shame that the food on the other hand is quite bad we ordered the special lamb sunday roast and i never had such overcooked lamb in my life and the beef was also over cooked the children sausage was some sort of over filled by stuff and very little meat thing that he would n t even look at let alone touch and the child is literally obsessed with sausage we been here before and it was n t this bad but really inexcusable prices for this quality of food,0,4,5,0,4,0,4.6443908991413725

this place is beautiful the owner has spent a lot of money on it we had a lovely server named fatima and she took good care of us the fillet steak was really nice and of a high quality the trimmings or lack of meant you have to pay for a lot of sides that you can often get with the steak itself the xmas meal was underwhelming as it was doused in gravy they took feedback for it though our child was given a meal on the house which was really sweet of them the violin player was really impatient and dramatic when our child was around her violin case this ruined the atmosphere,1,6,4,0,6,0,4.7535901911063645
filthy tables nobody cleaning my son and i intended to eat in but there were no clean tables you could see the crumbs and grease on the tables we took our food home to eat maybe that is what they prefer portions are smaller than other take away places and rather pricey for what you get i am going to i wo n t be going back which is a pity because the chicken spices are lovely,0,2,2,1,8,0,4.356708826689592

stayed dinner bed and breakfast on a great priced deal the hotel is being refurbished so is tired and run down in places our room was ok breakfast the first morning was something to be desired but this was due to a different chef on as the following morning it was lovely we had dinner in the bar downstairs the food was lovely and we were entitled to courses from the menu in with our room deal though no atmosphere to stick around all in all it was a fab offer though the quaint village is mins walk away if you want pubs cobbled streets and a good atmosphere,1,9,2,1,5,0,4.700480365792417
not much different than competition tried their classic recipe chicken was juicy and crispy fries were good chicken burger could be better not sure why but just was n t a big fan of that price maybe standard or a bit on the higher side for two people without taking both meals spent atmosphere was clean and comfy dips need to bought extra and they are each did n t like that,1,6,0,0,0,0,4.290459441148391

totally disappointed i hired out the function room for my little one first birthday on arrival to set up decorations i found the room had n t been cleaned and to be quite brutal messy there was tinsel and a coat hanger on the floor bits and food droppings in the carpet sticky and dirty tables not cleaned and left over balloons hanging from a previous party i fully expected the room to be cleaned and tidy for booking why would a function room not be cleaned down and ready for the next party i asked the member of staff working why the room had n t been cleaned and he could n t answer why he also did n t have a hoover to at least get rid of the food droppings i then asked if the heating could be turned on as it was cold i was advised the radiators did n t work how is this acceptable when january is exceptionally cold and not have working radiators when i had booked this venue i asked if the upstairs bar would be open to which i was told yes pending staffing a few days prior i was told the bar would be open but again another issue on the day only staff member working on the downstairs bar later on someone else did arrive to open the upstairs bar but had to leave i do n t expect party guests to keep going up and down the stairs to fetch drinks a big issue for a st birthday party was having no baby change facilities this should of been stated at the time of booking i would assume in baby change disabled facilities are important and mandatory i can not comment on the food here as luckily we took our own to finish the overall poor experience with this venue i completely forgot to ask for the deposit money back once our party had ended it taken a week of actually going to the pub calling leaving voicemails and text messages to obtain my deposit back i wo n t be returning obviously or recommending to anyone for future,0,11,7,1,20,0,5.8916442118257715

been going to this pub for years because the live entertainment is really good went there tonight for a few drinks with a friend and the old woman with blonde hair glasses and tattoos was so rude we went to the side bar which was totally empty ordered our drinks and started enjoying our night she rudely interrupted and said the bar would be getting busy to which i replied i know it not my first time here and we would move when it happens she then aggressively said she would get the manager to move me away from the bar when there was no need this caused further issues between myself and the barmaid i very strongly suggest not to hire people like this at an establishment where dealing with customers is your main job her people skills are non existent and is enough to put anyone off from coming back rude obnoxious and self entitled are the perfect words to describe this woman,0,8,8,1,10,0,5.111987788356544

i can never understand how a fast food restaurant can serve you cold food it would n t be acceptable for any other restaurant kitchen to send out cold food but somehow fast food seems to be an acception to this rule i just wanted a simple burger meal to eat in yes it is fast but its cold make burger serve burger there should be no time for it all to get cold how when it is really busy and surely all the food is being made to order as the orders come in can you serve people cold food then when you tell someone it is cold they roll their eyes at you and wander back off to the kitchen and then the person sitting across from you says they sent theirs back too because it was cold know these places are basically run by teenagers but this should be something the franchise owner should be keeping an eye on,0,3,1,1,7,0,5.093750200806762
second visit in a few months i must say it was a different eating experience this evening we arrived for the early bird buffet and were pleasantly surprised apologies for the pictures i opted for an eclectic mix to get a full taste experience things to note are the regular change out of food with it being aller serving trays you do have a higher turn over and this was reflected in the temp and texture one unfortunate let down was the cracked plate a real turn of for me second only to bent cutlery however as an all you can eat experience it ticks the boxes at reasonably priced depending on the time cheap and cheerful with a good standard of choice and quality staff are friendly and general service was ok i would come again for a convenient tasty trip out when you just do n t want to cook,1,7,1,0,8,0,5.030437921392435

if honest i found this petrol station quite a stressful experience nothing worse than needing to use the toilet and refuel ya van when you find there are two entrances right by each other and your hanging out the forecourt blocking the road as a driver decides to divert to your nearest pump rather than one they are lined up for walking in the store seemed nice and clean but the service to pay for fuel and give the vehicle registration left the cashier looking confused not sure what is confusing about pressing a few buttons but each to their own not sure if or when i will next be working in area but may have to look for a different better laid out bp forecourt as hanging on to the highway whilst waiting to fuel is n t good for disabled passerby or traffic,0,7,6,0,5,0,4.983606621708336
we visited the brixton branch for tacos priced at each despite expecting them to be small the disappointment came from their lack of flavor blandness and being very cold the vibrant decor did n t reflect in the food the proteins were tasteless and cold the tortilla dry even with added hot sauce the saving grace was a complimentary small margarita for signing up to their mailing list my friend enjoyed the fact that the fries were crispy on a friday evening we were initially surprised by the low turnout however after trying the food the lack of crowds did n t come as a surprise anymore,0,7,4,0,3,0,4.68213122712422

great value for money tasty food and amazing customer experience my wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order and the options become quite limited wherever we go the chef was very thorough and came to the table to discuss the options we ended up getting the vegetable biryani for myself i had the crispy fried vegetable momos not gluten free by the way they were spicy and delicious came with a sour cream sauce and a kind of sweet chilly sauce one thing i would highly suggest is to have halal chicken options there are a lot of muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal overall very reasonably priced and tasty could do with more halal and gluten free options,1,12,2,0,9,0,5.099866427824199

an unusual conversion of what i believe was an old mill into a hotel the reception and catering are on the top floor with the accommodation on two lower floors room was up to standard and i appreciated the tea coffee making kit as it was wet and gloomy over my stay the evening food menu was not very wide but my pizza was perfectly fine the continental breakfast was very good the only downside for me was the peculiar car parking arrangements the entrance to the hotel is basically in a pay and display car park so i had to feed a meter with minutes credit in the afternoon and skedaddle early in the morning to avoid paying any more for once probably best to be a pedestrian,1,8,5,0,6,0,4.867534450455582

fantastic location that overlooks the amazing view of the river very large terrace where you can take a seat and enjoy your meal drinks in the circle of your family or friends but the paramount of importance is the firepits which always get you warm in any kind of weather and will make you feel comfortable as at home food tastes differ but enjoyable,1,9,0,0,5,0,4.174387269895637

came in here for our evening meal most that we chose from the menu was not available so that was disappointing then took a while to order as we had to keep anyway we got there in the end i had a strawberry and lime cider which is always well tasty here my partner prefers tea so she had a refillable cup food was ready quite quickly as there were only locals drinking the food was lovely tasty very hot and on a hot plate too though our table was so messy when we got to it had to ask the staff to clean it for us obviously they do n t pay attention to service when people finish their meals ready for the next people then my partner needed to use the toilets there she said they were very dirty and this is very bad men would kind meerut up with it though not liking it certainly not acceptable for a woman this is not one of their better pubs that we have been to,0,10,5,0,11,0,5.176149732573829

we popped in to experience london cinema as well and did not regret at all the chairs are comfy plus double chairs were available in the last row screen is tiny as you can see on the video but it gives it a familiar feeling which we liked the small tables next to the seats make it super comfy for popcorn and drink not really if you plan to eat your pizza there prepare to be spending pounds for a ticket though plus a quid of fees if bought online,1,4,1,0,5,0,4.51085950651685
honestly the place just looked uncared for walking in the front there was no visible timetable you had to wander over to concessions and await a timed board to hit the movie you wanted to see worse three times i went by in my weeks in edinburgh the right shutter was kept shut one can only guess if this is mechanical failure or just lack of trying at this point ocean terminal generally gives the vibe of having given up and it feels this cinema has too shame as it used to be a really fun place to go,0,3,5,1,4,0,4.605170185988092
a very busy place but what more can i expect on a saturday night in the centre of glasgow the signage is n t obviously witherspoons but that may well be a planning requirement food as expected but considering how extremely busy it was i did n t have to wait and the service attention was also up to scratch well done all,1,2,0,0,2,0,4.1588830833596715

first time visitors from the us the atmosphere was nice the food was honestly so good i tried the mac cheese dish and it was top notch the service was ok to be fair i think for this night they may have been a bit understaffed there was a large party in the back and we did n t see our waitress much after our food came i think the poor thing was running around helping in the back i only mention it because i do n t know if this was a one time occurrence or if it is common here but they were busy not just sitting around ignoring us our bill was somehow lost as well we patiently waited understanding that they were obviously getting slammed with customers and we mentioned nothing and still the girl who came over to find settle our bill insisted on taking drinks off of our bill for the wait which was so very kind of her great meal on a busy night we were pleased with everything we would definitely go back the food was amazing i would love to try a few more dishes,1,15,3,0,18,0,5.272999558563747

overall it was a good place with nice vegan options and their vegan burger was delicious made with a bean patty although i just wish it was n t that deep fried their beef burger was good too but that too had too much of oil i personally prefer their skinny fries over chunky fries unfortunately could n t try their lemonade or other drinks because they were out restroom was not in a good condition,1,6,1,0,2,0,4.343805421853684

everything was normal in my interaction with the staff until one of the team enforced the rules of the shop by gettingbout of the front counter and shout at me from m standing in the middle of the shop full of other customers that were doing their purchases as well nothing wrong on enforcing the rules however my problem was the attitude and manner she did it to which i complied fully because i understand the business rules as well upon calling her to try and tell her that i did n t think her approach was not appropriate she became very agitated called the manager and said in a very unprofessional manner i do nt have to put up with this one member of the team tarnish the good job all the others did in my opinion it is a lucky star could been a star rate better front counter training is strongly advised,0,6,4,0,8,0,5.049856007249537
good place overall it was a really good experience i never had such as a delicious ice tea before as here food was a bit overfried oily and salty but still enjoyable free water and popcorn before meal staff is really friendly cleanliness was n t spot on and the place has a dress code that people did n t really seem to follow menu is really nice not the usual boring one you can choose from many things that you ca n t get anywhere else so we will definitely be back,1,8,1,0,4,0,4.543294782270004
came for a sunday roast with a few people was very excited because in the past i always raved of how good this place is for roasts have to admit the roasted leg of lamb was underwhelming the broccoli tasted a little overdone and have no flavour we was all underwhelmed hope it does improve again,0,5,1,1,2,0,4.04305126783455
i usually drink moonwake in the pub it was my first visit their brewery this place is a cool place there are so many different types of beer and we could taste any beer before we ordered staff are friendly and helpful as well however we could n t order any food in here except the crisps i would like to visit here again when they serve food,1,5,0,0,6,0,4.23410650459726
tacos were delicious definitely worth a try not much of a beer selection but all good what could be better is the amount of chips given with the guacamole or at least replenish them if there is still a good amount of guac remaining other than that we had a great experience here,1,7,0,0,1,0,3.9889840465642745

on the upside great asian variety good selection of roast dishes wide array of fast food style fried goodies such as nuggets onion rings chicken wings pizza and endless supply of soft serve and cup ice creams with gummies marshmallows and several other toppings including a chocolate fountain needless to say it was money well spent on the downside though lots of the rice dishes tasted rather bland as well as the roast but there was soo much variety there you are bound to find something flavoursome that will keep you going back for more i loved the duck pancakes,1,5,1,0,3,0,4.61512051684126
we went for dinner booked online but we decided to go earlier the restaurant was technically empty even on the rd of december but thanks to it the food and drinks were served very quickly and the waiters took care of us well we had scallops and sweet potato fries for appetizers and sides first beef tacos and chicken quesadilla for the main and the churros for dessert everything was so tasty and the portion was huge which i recommend sharing with friends or family however i got food poisoning from the scallops i felt my stomach was weird after eating at first and then i was throwing up after approximately hours of eating until the next morning i had a high fever and my throat hurt the next few days probably i got norovirus my friend was completely fine so i guess my stomach is sensitive just be careful with seafood in london in general,0,11,4,0,15,0,5.056245805348308
second time visiting mussel row and overall pleasant experience service was friendly with the right amount of attention main courses were great and fairly priced lamb cooked to perfection enough of potato and veg delicious dauphinois generous portion of seabass and tasty prawns the only disappointment was the scallops would like to see a more elevated and sophisticated dish on previous visit had the chowder and mackerel pate which were both delicious the interior is quite rustic and not to our taste so do n t let it put you off as it did for us previously,1,9,1,0,3,0,4.584967478670572

i have been coming here for breakfast almost three or more times a week for months the breakfasts are always of a good standard and usually sent out in a timely manner the menu has recently had an updated price which i find absolutely ridiculous you now charge extra for absolutely everything in the last few days i had eggs benedict with extra bacon and you charge for one slice of bacon this is unbelievable considering a pack of bacon is about for breakfasts with drinks you always allowed the speciality hot chocolate onto the added drink but now you do n t allow this even charging me full price for coffee with a syrup it was for this with smoothies which cost per smoothie even though supplier sells them at each previously we could eat a good breakfast in here with decent drinks for just shy of still expensive for doncaster but we always paid happily due to quality now i feel this rise in price does n t reflect the current state of people living standards making the place feel pretentious and only about making more money the average uk airport full english price is in yet you are charging in doncaster unbelievably ridiculous we wo n t be coming here anymore,0,5,3,0,13,0,5.3706380281276624

gorgeous food and reasonably priced came here with my best friend for dinner the portions are hearty and all the seafood is fresh and well seasoned service was n t the best apart from the obligatory is everything ok did n t really feel much of a vibe or atmosphere in this establishment and there was a sense of bore in the air we felt a little rushed to finish and get out despite the place not being booked out and the booking not being late there was a table by us that were spending a significant amount and clearly quite well off and all the stops were pulled out for them between me and my best friend with the photographed food and bottle of wine we still spent a significant amount and did not pay service on this occasion,1,13,3,0,6,0,4.948759890378168
order online for collection headed to the store to collect our pizzas walked inside and found all the staff just chatting to someone behind the counter who did n t work there any more while all facing me and looking at me no greeting or can i help you today or any sort of customer service after a few minutes of standing there at the counter like a lemon someone else comes through the door who the staff engage with another former staff member from what i can gather from the loud shouting conversation they are all having while still ongoing me few more minutes go past and one of them finally pipes up and just shouts at are you here to collect and just assumed my order honestly that was the rudest service i have ever had if they worked in my place of business i would be embarrassed to be there,0,5,3,1,12,0,5.0369526024136295

we order from here a lot always from their app i would say at least once a month and most of the time it is in acceptable or even good condition only time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft all the other times it was warm even though we are only a minute drive away but do n t drive on one occasion i found a hair and called to complain i was called a liar and when i asked to be put through to a manager i was told no manager was in but he would leave a message i never got a call back every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it they put tandoori chicken on it on their menu they have different kinds of chicken including plain logically if it does n t mention what kind it is you would assume it means plain we called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told of course we would never do otherwise last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it it is so strong tasting it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza we called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it is our fault that we did n t know that chicken means tandoori chicken i asked if they can at least change the menu so it is obvious you are not getting plain chicken but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid according to the reviews on just eat i am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description this time i was apparently speaking to a shift manager who clearly knows nothing about customer service he was incredibly rude and spoke over me i asked to speak to the store manager and was told they were n t in on a friday evening i asked to leave a message to be called back and yes you guessed it that call never came rude disrespectful and argumentative,0,9,15,1,28,0,5.921578419643816

went for breakfast here and it was awfull sat at a table trying to have a chat but could n t hear each other because the music was too feels a very weird place to sit in as there is loads of random mental decor nothing flowed the interior designer should be sacked for starters the table did n t feel clean the coffee was literally half a cup of foam we had a big breakfast a sausage and bacon buttie coffee and a coke it came to quid so certainly not cheap the staff were shouting across the dining area whilst we were trying to eat the sofa and chairs was n t very nice to eat on at all the sausages were not nice coffee was ok just half a cup the bacon was nice egg was snotty i had to ask for sauce black pudding was ok but the whole experience made me feel so uncomfortable i could n t even finish my breakfast i had nicer breakfasts from road side vans if i am honest wo n t be going back needless it looks alot better than it tastes the venue probably makes it seem worse,0,10,3,0,8,0,5.303304908059076

this th century tower is holding many historical stuff on display and were built in medieval times on a clear day you can have wonderful views from the rooftop museum itself was interesting but there were also other activities for all to enjoy narrow staircases are not so easy to use for everyone so careful but worth to do for beautiful city views it is location is good too just near to the riverside,1,9,0,0,1,0,4.31748811353631
this was a solid restaurant to eat in at backed by strong lights alongside images and messages on frames it was comfortable to sit on the leather that is accompanied by a table after ordering on the machine then waiting at the counter which displays the options clearly and has facilities like the napkins i picked up my zinger burger chips and robinson drink were all delicious which i ate in a clean area before discarding my waste in an appropriately sized bin the staff could have sorted out this restaurant better though since the machine did not print order receipts and they were careless bagging my drink causing it to spill on some of the food i went here again and waited minutes for hot wings yet the staff were considerate in giving me ones that tasted piping fresh,1,11,3,0,7,0,4.948759890378168
sound quality was really good and lots of legroom for taller viewers lines for food can get a bit long but there are free drink refills which is great did n t have too much interaction with staff but they seemed alright the toilets are n t the best though and there was a huge mess at the bin after our viewing i think bins closer to each screen door would be better,1,7,1,0,2,0,4.30406509320417

visited this harbour during the summer and what a beautiful place it was the place was bustling with life and it is a great place for families or travelling on your lonesome there is lot of food shops that sell fresh produce at reasonable prices there is also a lot of boats for hire and trips available i did find one or two locals who were not overly fond of outsiders but only muttered under their stanky breath as they did n t have the guts to say it to anyone face,1,4,1,0,2,0,4.532599493153256

i love the decorations of this restaurant the only downside is i think they have tried to put too many tables upstairs which makes it feel quite cramped the food is usually very good and they have a great range of vegan vegetarian and gluten free foods service is usually very good however you can sometimes wait quite a while to be seated,1,5,1,0,3,0,4.1588830833596715

been here many times and this review should be stars however today as i am writing this review i have not just taken into consideration the product coffee but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n t it the coffee from costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served stars for this today it was busy in this branch of costa vision retail park hartlepool and staff seemed very pushed for the duration i was there this obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves the coffee machines were dirty the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around along with it being very dirty for the customers to see pictures attached to the review interestingly the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout my question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out the staff were polite and accommodating and i have found this on every visit to this branch of costa so kudos to the team there despite today visit being a kind of scruffy experience with costa i will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings perhaps costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further,0,7,7,1,12,0,5.768320995793772
we ordered portion of jollof rice take away the chicken in there is usually a large one but instead it this mini size chicken it takes the piss as we paid for both portions and you would expect a decent size chicken i have been going to banana restaurant for over years and never had this small portion before let not even talk about the service as they tell you the food will be ready in mins and it take longer and they keep saying it coming while they make you wait it safe to say i will not be coming back there again,0,2,1,0,7,0,4.653960350157523

wow what a disappointment came as a party of got fed at different times so much so that by the time the last meal came the st was finished burger sent back as specified no salad came with salad steak ordered well done sent medium crab cakes were cooked differently and coloured differently the curry sauce which was served with it was covered in oil coleslaw was sour when desserts came fudge cake was like cardboard ice cream advertised as scoops came as teaspoons full served in a warm glass as a positive though our server katie was fantastic with us she was so helpful very smiley and polite and dealt with everything so well full credit to her the rest of the experience was very below par very disappointed and wo n t be back,0,12,3,1,2,0,4.919980925828125

we visited the ivy for a birthday celebration and were very disappointed the server did not understand the menu and gave us wrong information regarding vegetarian options multiple times we were then given a vegetarian menu and upon ordering we were told the menu was out of date and the options had changed were unavailable the afternoon tea was also below the usual standard as the sandwiches were dry stale and the chocolate dessert was topped with canned whipped cream followed by a whole pot of watery chocolate sauce the other cakes were also underwhelming and it was no surprise the table next to us left their cakes uneaten very disappointing experience,0,1,4,1,5,0,4.727387818712341

food was great and i recommend as it matched my pakistani taste buds but following observations no menu card i do n t know why ordered lamb haneed one portion with rice but if one person is eating they charge if two persons are eating they charge for the same quantity of food reason i do n t know i did n t get the free banana other tables where africans were eating they gave banana not to us sad i was with family so sat in family area which was alright but it was noisy in the restaurant chili sauce was very very very hot did n t like it but lemon soup was fantastic and soooper yummy staff was n t understanding english much it was tough to communicate but they were friendly i will still recommend for the taste,1,9,4,1,8,0,4.962844630259907
i had a rogan josh curry with chicken and garlic naan bread it was nice the food was filling and a good portion i really enjoyed the chicken my only gripe is that it did take a while to turn up about an hour but they did say minutes to an hour on the phone so i am appreciative that they were honest about the wait time only reason i am not giving stars will be ordering again though as the curry was flavorful and the chicken was really good,1,7,0,0,5,0,4.51085950651685
the pub fills up quickly you find your own table and then go order and pay at the bar we sat where they announced the discovery of dna nice atmosphere food was quite good actually especially the aged ribeye if you do not drink beer drinks could be a bit limited in choice we always try to pop in for a meal when we visit cambridge,1,2,2,0,6,0,4.204692619390966
overall for a first time we would give it out of quiet midweek night out for of us and pretty empty but inside is nice and inviting the staff that was on were nice friendly and happy to help with questions so stars with service used a coupon for a free garlic bread which was pretty small so we got a small bit each but was average taste but free so ca n t complain on that drinks cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe tried a new cocktail which i think is pricey at nearly and small no razzle dazzle food most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n t think was worth nearly same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other i tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu looked amazing online with the description pasta tasted lovely good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls i was not tasting the flavours i expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce people had desserts melting puddings and brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly i would visit again but with not such a big group due to costs but we still enjoyed the evening and enjoyable just not fantastic i m no food critic just an honest reviewer,1,24,6,1,13,0,5.659482215759621

a well structured market well known for varieties of products sold across diverse cultures and race i so much love the friendliness of sellers mostly the food market section fruits plantains sea food turkey soft and hard chicken home appliances clothes just to mention a few as an nigerian you would get almost all that you want except the green veggies which is not on sale just the pumpkin and sometimes water leaf as an heads up plan what you need else you might buy much more than you need,1,5,1,0,6,0,4.51085950651685
the carpet in the room was heavily worn and stained holes in the curtains the heating was n t working either so the room was freezing and you could see your breath the fire alarm went off in the basement for hours in the night and could n t be stopped tired and outdated the one redeeming feature is it is in a good location stars at best,0,2,6,0,2,0,4.23410650459726
have stayed at this novotel close to times in the past year and the primary reason for my preference is the location as it is right at the center of the town and many many great food options nearby the overall service is very good and the staff of the hotel is also very friendly the rooms are quiet and well furnished but the sofas in all the rooms were pretty dated and used the fitness room is pretty standard and the pool sauna is also nice to have would recommend but is overall a mid ranged costing option in reading center,1,9,0,0,1,0,4.634728988229636
very unassuming little place tucked away next to a pan shop juice stall and snacks shop service was quick both the times we ate here and the food was excellent they have a vast menu on one side wall other amenities restroom for customers washbasin as well as seating area is pretty limited but you go here for the great taste of their food not to sit down for a leisurely meal where else will you get a rava masala pav bhaji paneer supreme dosa along with your regular dahi puri and gobi paneer manchurian do n t forget to get a masala pan from the pan shop after your meal,1,5,3,0,5,0,4.718498871295094

shocking as a smoked haddock myself the filet of fish was atrocious i would n t have even fed it to my chicken friend in my profile photo he dead had me vomiting in the coral reef down bottom of my tank for hours straight not to mention the explosive diarrhoea i encountered on the way i think i have salmonella now good atmosphere though there was a banging rave on,0,3,2,0,8,0,4.276666119016055

well mcdonalds food is always tasty i think the electronic ordering stations inside the store are a great idea but i think you need to add another one more atleast to make it run more efficiently especially at lunchtimes and other busy times because when people have a short time to get food within their break times from work it can be very frustrating overall the staff are very friendly and helpful a nice clean restaurant,1,7,1,0,3,0,4.343805421853684
i had the vegan fiesta burger meal which comes with chips and onion rings you can choose to have this meal with a soft drink or alcohol i chose the raspberry lemonade it was a busy lunchtime on a wednesday afternoon the person who served me did n t know that my meal came with a drink the person who served my meal just put it down in front of me and walked off service was n t friendly but the food came fairly quickly i sat outside unfortunately the nicer seats out in the sun are for smokers and non smokers have to sit in the shade the meal itself was tasty,1,3,1,0,8,0,4.736198448394496
the staff are fantastic so friendly and welcoming and had a bit of a laugh and joke around with us including joking around with my step daughters as they were getting their pick and mix this helped to make the evening a bit more fun and enjoyable our film was on screen i think it was it was fine the screen was large and sound was good we sat towards the back in the middle so viewing angles were great the negative though were the seats which were a little uncomfortable especially as it got toward the end of the film because of this i have removed a star overall i would recommend coming here and we will be heading back for sure,1,13,2,0,8,0,4.820281565605037
i loved staying over at the premier inn in shrewsbury its location is very strategic in the town centre very close to the bus station darwin shopping mall and other beautiful shops and cafes it is also not far away from the train station which makes it perfect to easily catch a train rooms are very neat and spacious and they have good breakfast buffet overall i will recommend,1,7,0,0,2,0,4.248495242049359

came here to celebrate something special got in at pm first drink came at which was fine then came the wait we complained then the meal got served along with the second drink after we said we were leaving the wait was n t great no one explained anything until we complained after we finished eating the very bland food we waited another minutes before our tables got cleared this was after the waiter passed our table several times without paying any attention to us we had already ordered dessert along with the main meal but we still had to wait again after our main dishes had been cleared to even get that not sure i ever be back after this encounter that has left me feeling annoyed by everything the service the food not great at all because i had lost all my appetite by the time dessert was served,0,9,5,1,16,0,5.0238805208462765

nando is my absolute favourite place to eat at and i stopped by here after visiting worcester cathedral on a weekday food was lovely as usual and service was attentive only thing that could be improved upon is that there was no staff member by the door so guests who came in did have to wait a while to be seated although to be fair the wait was never more than a few minutes,1,3,2,1,2,0,4.31748811353631
all the review say they are terrible yet i tried these for the first time tonight through just eat ordered a munch box delivery was really quick food was tasty only comment is the curry sauce has a very fragrant taste and the shredded chicken is a bit dry but the chicken balls were excellent the rice was very nice and prawn toast amazing salt and pepper chips and ribs were so tasty would order again,1,3,1,0,1,0,4.343805421853684

decent place with good selection of shakes available the problem i had was that the shake was a little too thick which made it extremely hard for me to have with the straw they provided with the shake the shake taste was a little below average overall i suggest if you want to go to this place then do n t order the peanut butter shake as it very thick,0,2,6,0,4,0,4.2626798770413155
i really love this shop staff are pleasant even though i get there at the crack of dawn before the kitchen opens the chef makes my breakfast for me lovely atmosphere nice ambiance just love everything about it a little edit today i went in and asked what is the best coffee you have as i had not really liked the soya latte the last time the attendant said really humm ours is the best he proceeded to make one for me and it was delicious i kept on thinking of how cheerful he was etc and met him again today he said he was the owner ben what a humble and pleasant man,1,11,0,0,10,0,4.74493212836325

glen hansard nothing wrong with glen or ticketmaster this is for the venue operation or event sec staff they caused issues by stopping patrons re entering the concert standing area after using the lavatories phone calls or purchasing drinks within the rest of the venue grounds stated they were trying something new and that patrons could n t enter until the current song was over therefore missing the vast majority of some songs some doors operated this others did n t at times i was stopped i was kept stood beside the doors that continued to open to allow people to exit to go to the lavatory also get hit and injured by the doors as those feeling unwell were rushed out the side doors the large double doors were regularly opening anyway due to people exiting just let those who exited back in having event sec doormen covering the internal doors in this manner is not called for and spoiled this experience,0,2,5,0,2,0,5.099866427824199

my dining experience left me slightly disappointed as the meal quantity fell short of my expectations despite the speedy preparation the portion size failed to match that of other mcdonald outlets in the city the table untidiness further added to the less than ideal atmosphere although it is in the city center which makes it a perfectly accessible spot for burger enthusiasts however the familiar delight of mcdonald taste remained consistently excellent as expected the flavors and quality of the food continue to be a commendable aspect providing a satisfying culinary experience while the quantity and tidiness aspects may have left room for improvement the unwavering taste quality reaffirms mcdonald commitment to delivering a consistently delicious dining experience despite the minor shortcomings the familiar and delightful taste ensures that mcdonald remains a reliable choice for those seeking a flavorful and enjoyable meal,0,11,2,0,3,0,4.962844630259907

this venue has been a welcome addition to the otherwise bland and limited offering that shrewsbury has to offer a packed and vibrant atmosphere with attentive friendly staff clearly please couples groups of friends and family patrons it has always been busy when we have dined here and booking especially at the weekends is a must the burgers are ok but do not rival those of the beefy boys venue also in town the spicy chicken wings are seriously hot and this may well have affected my taste buds and enjoyment of the burger but my overall impression was that it was pretty standard in nature good drinks menu and calorie rich deserts make for an indulgent and satisfying end to what was a pleasant trip to this popular destination restaurant no doubt we shall return soon,1,16,5,1,4,0,4.927253685157205

first off this is not about the food while we all know it not healthy eating it was prepared well and the grey shirts in mac donald work very hard and i appreciate their service but when i order something and get the wrong thing it annoys me when i question my order to the white shirt taking my order and he tells me he has done it right even though i insisted i was being charged too much this annoys me when i walk minutes to my office before sitting to eat open it to find the wrong stuff it annoys me off i already had to stand waiting for several minutes in a quiet restaurant it definitely was n t busy before asking to be served and that annoyed me overall unimpressed by the man in the white shirt and annoyed again thank you to the grey shirts for the continued hard work white shirt manager person you owe me money and believe me when i say i will be in to let you know my feelings,0,8,11,0,24,0,5.19295685089021

interesting place food was nice though the choices were a little limited for my tastes the organisation and service was excellent and ca n t be faulted at all fantastic staff all round space at our table was very tight there were eight of us especially during our meal but that is n t a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night the entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all inclusive holiday hotel and a haven caravan site it was loosely themed on moulin rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative the night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables the overall experience was certainly not what i was expecting and in all fairness was n t really my sort of thing but it was certainly an experience and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required just under i would recommend the place if you like this participative cabaret type of night or for a themed christmas party,1,12,2,0,9,0,5.313205979041787

pretty trendy pizza place but was n t amazed by it the atmosphere was nice but very loud with fans going nonstop the pizza itself was alright but not good enough to warrant a return trip here i know that oil is in the name but i was n t expecting the ridiculous levels of oil on this pizza the service was slow but very friendly i do n t want to mark them down too much here because there were only two members of staff doing all the service for a full restaurant overall it was n t great but it was n t bad at all if you a fan of this oily cheesy pizza it well worth a visit but it was n t to my taste,0,11,2,0,5,0,4.875197323201151
this place is very busy popular went there on a sunday morning at about had to wait mins for a table so had a coffee in the front i got a table outside in a nice courtyard slow service but they were very busy the food well i would say it got a non theme i had the big kiwi breakfast as i wanted as close to quality tasty traditional irish breakfast as i could get here the bacon was streaky i prefer back bacon as i do n t want loads of fat the sausage lacked taste they had ciabatta which was very hard on the edges would have preferred some quality bread toasted but that just my preference it probably just not the place for me perhaps too traditional on breakfasts but this place will be great for the non traditionalists,1,5,1,0,9,0,4.969813299576001

unfortunate birthday at nando seeking a laid back atmosphere for my new year eve birthday while i was feeling unwell nando seemed like the perfect choice until our dinner plans turned into disappointment the news of running out of whole chicken extended our wait to minutes hoping to salvage the evening we ordered chicken livers as a starter priced at a hefty to our surprise it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll and an extra roll set us back another quid as a proud portuguese i can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost the seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury to compound matters our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived necessitating a return to the grill by the time we finally sat down to eat at pm an hour later the restaurant was closing leaving us no choice but to take our meal away the saving grace the staff friendliness nando charging a premium for mediocre dishes wo n t cut it what is happening to british hospitality portions and quality are decreasing yet prices are rising,0,8,6,1,12,0,5.267858159063328

it is always nice to try a different curry house especially when they are good like this we wanted to see what specialities they had and asked for recommendations from the waitress who was really helpful and very nice the red onion chutney was a favourite with the poppadoms starters of lamb chops and chicken tikka were average but the onion bhajis were really good mains were where things got really good the lamb lababdaar was fantastic with a very good chicken tikka dish and saag paneer rice and naan were nice but the portions were a little on the small side great meal overall but the venue was let down by the fact the lighting was very bright and a little stark and whenever anyone opened the door there was nothing to prevent a very cold draught,1,12,0,0,1,0,4.9344739331306915

this cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around less than per person even when booking our tickets online my husband and i went at the end of march i have a disability so arrived a little earlier to allow time to get from the nearby car park to the cinema as there is no parking outside the building the lift is quite hidden and easily missed it was rather old looking much like the rest of the cinema and very very slow going both up and down anyone who does n t like being in a lift much will probably not like this one as it is also rather small sadly most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability i managed a hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting which is good for me despite the few negative points i will definitely come again mainly due to how close it is to my home and the fact that it does n t cost us an arm and a leg,1,8,5,1,10,0,5.247024072160486

i work near the place and always heard good things and when i pass it in the afternoon it smells divine so after all these years my missus and i gave it a shot we had a baby with us so we parked up outside and called it in we get somewhat the same from our local chinese which are common items so that is fine min wait which is great especially since there was a steady stream of customers always a few cars parked waiting the price was good maybe slightly higher than our local but within the ball range the special fired rice was great and so was the gravy and the missus loved hers but we always get a portion of salt and pepper chips and me being a fatty chicken i think it was strips sadly the range brings it down feels more like an after thought than a proper dish it was fine though a great take out overall and well priced the smell did n t let me down and still makes me straving when i go past,1,12,2,0,16,0,5.220355825078324
it is a very good pub the food is also nice but the price is too high for the size you get so sorry to add this comment i just could n t believe plus service on chicken strips it is just not worth it eating out i am not sure how that can be improved,1,5,1,0,3,0,4.04305126783455
nice food very tasty the portion was not that big though quite expensive you should book before going we waited a bit to get a table also when you order a main dish you do n t know what exactly in it so hard to order a sider without exactly knowing the main dish so you better ask my celiac friend had lots of options she was so happy yet no gluten free beer unfortunately yet many gluten free dishes,1,6,3,1,6,0,4.394449154672439
the added touch to this wetherspoons is the quality and design of the building generally you know what you will get from wetherspoons which is great value food and each of which you probably get the best choice from any chain in the country but this one is different with it being in an old cinema and bingo hall so it has retained the character from it heritage we made a couple of changes from the actual meal items and were served as requested a big breakfast for held off on the eggs and a fiesta brunch at extra sausage and bacon added tea and coffee at each where you get unlimited refills at this price just adds to the appeal and value nowhere in the uk gives such decent sized portions with quality food at those prices i will happily go to wetherspoons for breakfast any day of the week,1,6,0,0,6,0,5.0238805208462765

entering as a walk in the venue was very accommodating and were able to find a table for two very quickly we were provided with drinks also very quickly which was very good service the service was the highlight of this visit the low rating is due to the food we ordered a seafood vongole and a seafood risotto with a side of truffle fries and tenderstem broccoli the brocoli and the fries were lovely but we were both deeply disappointed with our main dishes both were bland lacked seasoning and neither tasted of seafood we found ourselves prioritising the brocoli and fries which was noted by the attentive staff how a plate of clams and pasta can taste of nothing was beyond my imagination for such a highly rated restaurant,0,3,2,0,6,0,4.882801922586371

it was a working lunch met a client and was lunchtime so wanted something warming considering it was c outside found this place by chance whilst driving through had to pay for parking so was annoyed but this is sadly london i guess was greeted immediately and i knew what i wanted already had a lamb shish with rice but it was without asking served with a bowl of side salad bulgar wheat fresh pitta bread and the chilli sauce tasted splendid the lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender juicy and succulent as the last the rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish as opposed to just the pitta or chips it was warming and had a gentle buttery taste interior was simple yet beautiful a modern and classic mixed look there even a veiled prayer booth section at the back now you may not pray or be of the islamic faith but the addition of such a room was thoughtful and it blended in and added to the whole ambience very competitively priced for a passing lunch recommended,1,14,3,0,4,0,5.225746673713202

when ordering for delivery the burgers always arrive fine but the issue is the chips they arrive either soggy overcooked or stone cold when i regularly visit london and order food to my hotel everything arrives perfect the amount of chips bracknell puts in is a of the amount compared with other branches i ordered large chips and they barely fed two people yet london they happily fed a family of staff need retraining on how to cook chips which should be made fresh for online orders as they are travelling and please stop putting milkshakes next to burgers and chips i can not continue spending large sums of money for warmed up milkshakes cold food and tiny chip portions,0,6,1,0,4,0,4.795790545596741
this place is not really suitable for the general public it totally dominated by delivery drivers who seem to get preferential treatment took an age for my food to arrive as usual the fries were a joke claims from kfc that they have improved are totally unfounded they terrible chicken and gravy were delicious as usual i hate visiting this place i ca n t get delivery where i live so i have to collect if you prepared to pay the extra fees get a delivery,0,4,3,0,6,0,4.465908118654584

chikaros nestled in the heart of west bromwich offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates during my recent visit i embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed upon entering the cozy ambiance of chikaros i was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff the menu boasting an array of enticing options immediately caught my attention from traditional classics to innovative creations there was something to please every taste bud i opted for the chef kebabish a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices each bite was a symphony of flavors showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs the tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes equally impressive was the classic parmesan a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at chikaros the crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese it was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more however despite the culinary delights i was disappointed to discover that chikaros does not accept card payments while this may not deter cash carrying patrons it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions it is a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless overall my experience at chikaros was nothing short of exceptional from the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality it is clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences whether you are craving traditional favorites or eager to explore new culinary horizons chikaros is sure to delight your senses and leave you coming back for more,1,30,4,0,12,0,5.680172609017068
some nando are not much better than a kfc with fancy seats but this one is not one of those it pretty good and so far every time i have been it worked well normally the food is prepared well ok sometimes they are a better than others and if it busy the standard drops but only as far as the normal in lots of other nando decor is good service is always friendly and atmosphere is nicely relaxed clean tidy friendly inexpensive and great for a casual meal,1,16,0,0,1,0,4.499809670330265
the place is lovely lovely servers and lovely atmosphere however every time i happen to go in there the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients all times i have been my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them for example my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie when told they ca n t make my specific smoothie they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so i picked one of those a few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n t make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice at this point it has n t even reached peak hours on top of this there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n t fresh whatsoever i really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances for example i am lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options i ended up asking for a hot chocolate instead and giving it to my partner who complained how it tasted like it had n t been mixed at all for the prices there is definitely room for improvement regarding the drinks and food i am disappointed to say the least,0,13,7,1,14,0,5.5053315359323625

stayed here from tuesday nd till friday th as with any premier inn they a budget hotel that provides what you need at a reasonable price without the frills the staff all excellent very friendly and happy to attend to all needs despite the reception staff seemingly doing everything from kitchen waitering and of course manning the reception all staff i encountered are the rooms as you would expect basic but functional they were very clean all bar a little stain on the sheet but did n t impact my stay only downside i occurred is the toilet paper it is in a dispenser and provides singular sheets as with all premier inns i not a fan of this as sometimes it tricky if the sheets do n t dispense a roll is much better restaurant staff as mentioned are excellent and very attentive food whilst taste is ok is nothing special and the menu for the evening meal is extremely limited portions are of good size breakfast once again very limited but contains all the essentials additional fruit and yogurts would be great though all in all a typical premier inn parking is per entry of the car park in a nearby multi story enter reg at reception would stay again,1,11,4,0,6,0,5.3612921657094255

first time visit today we will be coming back the first waitress was quick to seat us with menus which are pretty extensive the second waitress was a little too eager to take our order we had only just started looking through the menu but was happy to wait we eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream of which there is a vast choice of flavours a strawberry gelato milkshake and the brookie we were also given a taster plate of macarons these were far less favourable than our order the waitress was n t sure of the flavours but we guessed at x coffee which we did nt try as we dislike coffee x pistachio which did nt taste of anything and x strawberry which was quite nondescript just sweet as they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them we would be disappointed from what we tried all of them were prepared quickly and were delicious the brookie being a particular favourite although parking is a bit of an issue particularly for those who are less able we are looking forward to coming back again and will likely recommend it,1,9,2,0,14,0,5.337538079701318

really sad to post a star review as we were really looking forward to eating here ordered a prawn curry chicken korma pilau rice and garlic naan rice was freezing cold we live right next door so nothing to do with the journey home naan had no flavour and had an awful texture the chicken in the korma was on the bone and pink in the middle so could n t be eaten i have given a star as the prawn curry was nice and flavours in the sauce were fab lots of oil floating on top though ca n t pay by card in the restaurant which seems unusual in this day and age and also a pain because of having to walk to cash machine unfortunately my partner has now had to go out and order another chicken curry and naans from another restaurant,0,3,7,1,4,0,4.990432586778736

the food was amazing both the pies and the fries were fresh made the ambiance was lively and enjoyable and the decoration is an experience in itself however our experience was definitely affected by our server she was very rude and repeatedly rushed us we had just arrived and as we were taking our coats off she asked if we were ready to order she then came again not two minutes after that and asked once again by the third time when we hurried to choose so as to not be pressured again she quickly responded thank god when we said we were ready she then proceeded to ask us to leave when she saw we had finished our food but i guess she must not have noticed we still had our drinks i would still go back the place is located beautifully and the food was good it is definitely an experience worth doing while visiting canterbury,1,13,4,0,17,0,5.0689042022202315

the coffee itself was very disappointing it lacked any depth or flavor and tasted like it had been watered down it was almost as if i was drinking warm brown water instead of a good cup of coffee i was expecting a more robust and flavorful coffee from a popular bakery chain like greggs but unfortunately i was let down to make matters worse the lid of my coffee cup was extremely greasy it was as if it had been touched with oily hands before being placed on my cup,0,6,3,0,5,0,4.51085950651685
fist visit here today on recommendation very impressed with the selection of food on offer and an excellent range depending on your tastes i opted for the chicken chasni pie which was absolutely lovely really tasty chicken and the chasni sauce was very good the pie itself was lovely and hot contents and crisp crust with not a hint of soggy bottom which is very important the pie maintained its structure when being ate which was excellent as nothing was spilt at all and no sauce running down the hands the carry out containers were made of card and of a substantial quality highly recommend this shop and look forward to my next visit,1,9,1,1,3,0,4.74493212836325

went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with pizza hut in hayes i was pleasantly surprised the first thing i noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked the crust golden like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque caribbean beach perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect secondly the cheese was there usually i am second guessing myself wondering if i had accidentally clicked the extra dough option when ordering rather than extra cheese this time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency something that i wo n t deduct points for anyway having a few slices with a bit less cheese knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal the sauce was plenty ladled and because the pizza was n t overcooked the toppings were juicy and tender remember if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop i guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves or they just care about their customers all in all great experience,1,9,2,0,10,0,5.303304908059076

where to start firstly our waitress was so bad uncaring and not customer focused slow lady she took our drink orders and then a lady behind the bar served the drinks to us i told her that we are ready to make food order she said it is not her responsibility but amazingly kindly she came back from the bar and took our order where was our waitress at the same time being bored with the other waitresses sort of we were waiting long minutes and the food did n t arrive i went to the bored waitresses to ask for my food because neither of them bothered to come to our table for mins to ask if we need anything and the place was n t busy at all by that time they looked at me with a surprise food you did n t order food indeed i did the lady from bar turned up after serving a customer she apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food she offered our food on the house at this point she kept on apologizing she was an excellent employee and customer service from her the waitresses still did n t bother i think the team work is bad here why everything is relying on the chef lady the food was absolutely amazing i really enjoyed it i left the place happily and would return only because of the chef lady who apologised before we left again and i gave her a tip,0,10,7,0,23,0,5.560681631015528

this mexican restaurant in penrith is a great find we decided to try their set menu which was delicious and more than enough to satisfy our group i highly recommend their ceviche fried chicken and watermelon salad best enjoyed with their classic margarita the only hiccup during our visit was the wait time we waited for over minutes for our reservation the hostess was apologetic and we understood that our group was quite large with other big parties in the restaurant however some improved reservation management could enhance the overall dining experience,1,8,0,0,8,0,4.532599493153256

i found this restaurant by the recommendation of a nepali friend so i gave it a try we ordered samosas and a fried chicken sausage for appetisers and they were pretty good and for mains the fried rice was unlike any i had tasted before and the bamboo jhol momo offered a new culinary experience in adelaide while the pomegranate mojito was refreshing the khukuri katta cocktail was a disappointment as it served warm and tasted overly syrupy that was overpowering which i did n t enjoy at all everything was good except for the live music going on which was overly loud for a small venue and it kills the entire vibe of having a decent meal at a restaurant we had to talk loud among ourselves to have a conversation the portion sizes are average and the prices are reasonable for a cbd restaurant the service could also improve a bit but nothing really bad overall it was a good experience and i hope to go back to try their,1,9,3,0,7,0,5.153291594497779
friendly super fast service ordered a piece of snapper and the calamari box which was big strips of calamari perfectly cooked in a crispy thinnish batter the large piece of snapper was also perfectly cooked in the same crispy batter but was a bit thicker in places the serve of chips was on the smaller side but the size of the snapper fillet more than compensated especially at only fabulous bargain for great tasting fish,1,7,0,0,0,0,4.330733340286331

the coffee is exceptional here like next level beautiful flavour expertly made and very nicely presented it an all round winner that emphatically underscores the view that you can get great coffee in regional areas nice egg and bacon roll here a generous size with a good amount of egg and bacon the tomato relish was a little too sweet for me though and it was so liberally applied that it oozed out the side of the roll with the slightest pressure the chicken and pesto roll thingy was a tiny bit disappointing for me i found it a bit bland and over complicated but not so for my partner who enjoyed it it not cheap here but it all good quality the cafe is small and it nicely and fashionably set out in the urban hipster style with some good tables on the street it was doing a very brisk takeaway trade while we were here and plenty of people were on the outside tables too the staff were young and friendly and doing a good job in an amiable way it a good place coffee is taken ultra seriously here and it a highlight most city places do n t make coffee this good,1,19,3,0,6,0,5.332718793265369

nothing special at all the store was reasonably clean and i was served promptly however that is for the most part where the positives end ordered a chicken roll which you would usually expect to have mayo stuffing on and perhaps cheese we got plain chicken stuffed into a roll that was bland though both the roll and chicken were cleary fresh the chips were decent but nothing special and quite a large portion we got a small which was huge the drinks fridge was poorly stocked and our preferred drinks were all out of stock forcing us to pay extra for an upgrade size which was still not our preferred drink but better then than van options whilst the service was good and the food fresh i do n t think we will be back again,0,9,1,0,9,0,4.927253685157205

came here in the sweet spot around at the end of their lunch deals going into their happy hour so enjoyed the best value service was very good with all the staff being friendly and attentive food was satisfying but the difference in dough between the garlic bread and pizza was a shame or cooking style i do n t know either way the garlic bread was perfect and soft but the pizza was crispy and dry if the pizza base was as soft as the garlic bread this would be easy star the cocktail was nice but a bit heavy on the soda i think as it was a bit watered down and the flavour went fast good value nevertheless would probably pop in for garlic bread and a drink,1,13,1,0,2,0,4.882801922586371
went to the parkview today to meet up with friends who are back in town for christmas the beer garden is great but for some reason food was not allowed or being served outside today i ca n t fathom why a pub would not want to serve food in their most popular area on one of the busiest days to start off with this is against rsa best practices and will almost certainly lead to more alcohol related incidents in addition to this they would have lost revenue and customers by not serving food where they were enjoying the venue it is a great venue otherwise but this really let down the experience today,0,8,1,0,1,0,4.7535901911063645

very good hotel located in the perth cbd close to the ferry terminals and railway stations the room was quite spacious and clean i found the bed comfortable the room had all the necessary amenities though there was n t much room in the bar fridge as it was full of soft drink and alcohol bottles the reception staff were excellent both when checking in and checking out ensuring that the transaction to refund the bond was put through immediately when checking out a complimentary coffee voucher was given when checking in to be redeemed at the hotel cafe there were also free movies that could be accessed in the room,1,8,0,0,1,0,4.718498871295094
the bundaburg services club is a place of nice music and wonderful workers as well as good prices for their food and services unlike other establishments the drinks were well made and the bar workers were quick and efficient in their work the woman behind the counter was wonderful and fast at taking orders the view from the windows out the back had a gorgeous view however the plastic plants added to the look from upstairs near the bar but took the nice view from below and made them look out of place aswell as they are strict on their clothing policyno open shoes thongs and no torn or dirty clothing ok now for the important part about minutes after i ordered the food arrived at my table the food i had steak chips vegetables and a breadroll the steak was amazing and flavourful but the chips were bland then with salt turned from bland to impressive the odd thing not much of a salt flavour after adding salt the breadroll was well a bread roll it was cold but cooked and the butter was actually solid instead of liquid so plus points for that and finally the vegetables sweet potato pumpkin carrot not as nice as the other food but healthy overall how nice and easy employees were to talk to food speed of service drinks decorations can recommend coming here for lunch or dinner,1,21,4,1,3,0,5.4680601411351315

the enclosed park is good except it has a building that kids can climb through part of it and get out of the enclosed park which leads down to a creek the creek is filthy with rubbish there are good things for kids to play on and have fun it is quiet and kept clean there were police walking through while we were there which was great to see there are homeless people living in the gazebo which is a bit messy and unwelcoming the toilets were clean and in good order over all its a reasonable place to go and spend some time for all ages of kids,1,8,1,0,1,0,4.700480365792417
this is more of a fine dining restaurant it a little bit pricey and the portion size is also quite small however the food is delicious and beautifully presented the food is served quite fast and the dining area is quite spacious too although with many people in there i do n t have to speak loudly to be heard it actually a nice place for catching up the only downside is that only one person takes your order so you might need to wait before you can place your order,1,4,1,0,5,0,4.5217885770490405

we recently stayed at the adina and i have to say we were thoroughly disappointed with the room we were allocated the hotel was fully booked and i feel as though the room we were given should n t of been offered to guests it smelled like dank musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home there was visible dust on the tv cabinet and on the first night our air conditioner did n t work the next morning the manager who was quick to respond to our request came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again at least it worked not only was the hotel in bad shape but the city too there is a tab just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people my son age dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the tab patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron they were about to get into a physical altercation we crossed the road very quickly we felt very unsafe the city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk all i could smell was human urine i wo n t be staying at this hotel or in the cbd for some time after this experience,0,2,5,0,19,0,5.459585514144159

very surprised and disappointed upon arrival compared to what you read on the internet the parking is located offsite which feels very unsafe due to unhoused neighbours once you finally make the minute walk back to the hotel it is another minutes to your room when you have severe asthma this is not ideal i wish the parking situation was a lot more clear at the point of check out i would have reconsidered the location in the event of an emergency fire the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building the evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand both bed side lamps are faulty and almost zapped me when i turned the first one on to top it all off x dogs are located in the apartment below which bark every time you go out on the balcony not the star stay i was hoping for the room however is large and clean and the best part of the whole experience would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone for the price you pay and rating it has on other websites i am incredibly disappointed,0,9,8,0,13,0,5.303304908059076

very delicious food and very nice ambience the only reason i left one star less is because their lamb seekh kebab as in the second photo i thought were lacking the typical indian pakistani flavour rest of all the dishes food was very delicious and in true taste the seekh kebab seemed like they toned the taste down to make them aussie friendly which is fair but i think they pushed too far and removed all spices that are the essence of seekh kebabs i will return and hope they improve the seekh kebab too as all the other items were mouth watering thank you for having us and for the great service,1,11,0,0,6,0,4.736198448394496

delicious food and also artfully presented we love the vibe of this place and the food definitely delivers the coffee is also really really nice and love getting one with our meal and then one for takeaway on our way out the only critique would be that ordering can be a bit slow with the lineup for such a big restaurant maybe qr codes or table service would do the trick as you can easily wait in line to order for minutes also was almost charged the card surcharge when paying cash,1,6,2,0,4,0,4.532599493153256

visited on a friday afternoon for a beer and dinner we were quite surprised how quiet it was in the public bar we had been there previously a number of years ago and the contrast was very noticeable the staff in the restaurant were great and super friendly the same ca n t be said about the bar staff in the public bar either they were having a bad day or perhaps they have been there too long but they were not friendly at all unfortunately the food in the restaurant was very average i had the salmon which came with a generous serving of mashed sweet potato and some broccoli the salmon was very dry and with no sauce for i would expect better standards than that my colleague had the steak which a bit overcooked for medium overall this establishment has not changed much over the years perhaps a refit is needed to liven the place up a bit,0,9,3,1,5,0,5.087596335232384

been to this macca a few times recently chips have been cold on more than one occasion floor is very dirty with rubbish as for the customer service it seems that basic manners and customer service skills do n t exist anymore no acknowledgement from staff not even a simple smile at any point and no eye contact when giving you your order it macca after all but it would be nice for staff to work on their rbf and treat customers like the valued customer name printed on the order ticket you have to change the name of happy meals if staff keep up this attitude,0,7,3,1,3,0,4.68213122712422

the location is good the room was decent but the lounge is incredibly uncomfortable and on the last night that i was there the air conditioner stopped turning on the main problem i have with this place is the card system it is one of those card insert systems but sometimes it does n t register your card for at least times one time i tried times this is so frustrating when you get into the elevator and while you are trying to use the card someone on one of the top floors calls the elevator and then you are stuck in it riding it going all the way to the top then picking up any others that have called the elevator on the way down what should be a second trip to level ends up being a min scenic tour of the entire building,0,3,5,0,7,0,4.983606621708336

tasty fresh what a great local pizza shop had the nicest pizza from this store delivered fresh hot and on my door step in a pretty reasonable time from placing order great selection of pizzas with beautiful toppings it is nice to see the good old favourite pizza flavours that everyone knows and loves but also some great new combination of flavours that make a pizza that little bit extra special i really liked the selection on the menu and the pizzas themselves were beautifully made with fresh ingredients you could actually taste the quality prices are little bit on the higher end of the scale but you pay for what you get and that is a great pizza will definitely order from buderim pizza company again,1,17,1,0,5,0,4.852030263919617

a small family run business operated by really genuine people not the place to go if you are after luxurious surroundings or black tie service but the coffee is as good as i have tasted in port macquarie and the service could not be more helpful or attentive we brunched and enjoyed it completely seating is limited and a booking is a good idea if you want to go on saturday morning parking during the week is very limited due to the proximity to the former hospital now a mixed health and administration complex,1,5,2,0,4,0,4.553876891600541

buckley street pizza and burgers is a great place to grab a feed the pizza base in my opinion is unique in the sense that it is like a deep dish with a really nice crispy crust and a light soft dough the toppings were nice as well the cowboy burger was also a really nice burger it comes with a side of chips the chips were beautifully golden and crispy i could n t fault them at all if you are in the area and trying to decide what to get for dinner i highly recommend giving buckley street pizza and burgers a crack,1,9,1,0,4,0,4.663439094112067

bugger all light in the car park at night pretty disappointed about the place it smelt clean but i have never felt so dirty unhygienic being in a public space every ball is chipped which sent us to the gutter almost every bowl lanes are very short and thin lanes looked barely oiled basically everything in there was paint chipped or damaged in some way not nice to see for a new place we ended up only paying for game because it was such a disappointment to watch the balls literally bounce down because of the chips and dents the lounges were really nice and the staff were nice too for the same price you can go to sunset super bowl and have nice clean balls and a better experience,0,9,4,0,4,0,4.875197323201151

first time at neighbourhood today went down with my life little girl and our friend with kids of her own pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the warragul cbd area greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back i appreciated this very much our coffee came out first i ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee i ordered the breaky croissant my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns and we got our little one a cookie cookie passed the test with our year old my wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls fry oil clean and you have an unhappy dining experience breaky croissant i have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot toasted closed so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate ca n t fault the service today was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite accommodating and friendly finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid for the cookie and a total of for not a great product could have been and did expect a mich better overall experience at neighbourhood today i am debating about going back i think one more attempt is warranted,0,16,8,0,21,0,5.66988092298052

not a good experience here travelling through adelaide to melbourne looking for a quick bite to eat the toilets were absolutely disgusting gag worthy the one cistern was blocked and the one one urinal was not in good shape smell was horrendous it took over ten minutes for our order to be completed seemingly a grilled chicken salad is not a staple order here as it took an eternity to make looked terrible and whilst it was being made everything else went cold terrible wo n t be back here,0,3,6,0,1,0,4.51085950651685

dropped in here on the way through to orange recently a cold and foggy drive over the mountain but was greeted by a warm and friendly pub just off the main road in bathurst it was a thursday night so the place was n t humming with people but the service was great and the food even better i am an absolute lover of country pubs in particular the food and the family hotel did nt disappoint my wife ordered the curry no pictures sorry and i took advantage of the bangers and mash a couple of points here the sausages were clearly made at a butchers or in house no mass production here juicy meaty not much more to ask for but there was more the gravy on point and as a nice little touch that you barely see in the city mashed peas to compliment the mashed potatoes a welcome addition and one i want to see more of in the city overall happy we stopped here could have strapped in and watched the footy but the drive ahead still needed to be completed well done family hotel bathurst will recommend and will try to stop by again next time we are over the mountain,1,15,6,1,7,0,5.337538079701318

surprisingly easy to navigate safely given its size victoria square tarntanyangga is a gathering place as much as it is an artery for movement through the city many events are received and or hosted here including sports events and holiday festivals the parks are nice and many people recreate partaking in health fitness and family activities throughout the day victoria square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful more native vegetation would be appreciated but the open spaces must be preserved for practical reasons one other thing worth noting is the cooling effect of this green open space it is significant and airflow is definitely increased within the city because of it which is important because adelaide is prone to hot summers,1,14,0,0,0,0,4.875197323201151

all was wonderful the meat is to devour the gyros wrap is a generous fill of flavour with the venue some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain but that is just my preference as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together that is just my perfectionism the bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe the staff are prompt and professional most of all it looks clean and food handling practice excellent music is not too loud thankfully ca n t wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future highly recommend such a pleasure talking to andrew too,1,13,0,0,2,0,4.812184355372417

interesting marker however this is not a great tourist attraction the optimal photo taking distance requires stepping onto and crossing the adjacent roadway due to the marker being located adjacent an intersection this poses a high risk as vehicles turning into the street off the main road may not see pedestrians focused on taking photos furthermore those taking photos will find it hard to check for traffic,0,5,2,0,0,0,4.219507705176107

i had a really good chai latte here with good flavour and temperature i stayed a while with a friend and grabbed a matcha latte to takeaway at the end of my visit but it was n t very hot unfortunately but was made by the same lady hot drinks are a reasonable price at for a large no discount for bringing my reusable cup but a good price nevertheless the eggs benedict and the other food all looked amazing quality ingredients and well presented on the plate the date brownie dessert from the fridge was nearly for quite a small piece so i passed but it looked delicious prices in the fridge would perhaps entice me to buy something next time i like to know what i am buying and how much it will cost me without having to ask the waitress about every item i am interested in and hold up people behind me by taking up the staff valuable time the beetroot latte sounded interesting service was friendly beware of the european wasps out the back which go for your food sugary drinks and buzz around you we moved inside and thankfully they did n t follow us i would like to suggest they get an exterminator to find and kill the nearby nest of this aggressive introduced species of wasp air conditioning was comfortable as was the booth seating it is dog friendly out the back plenty of street parking in the area could be a good place to sit and work on a laptop for a couple of hours but i did n t notice any powerpoints so my go to would still be maccas for longer stints a good little shop at the front for pantry staples and fresh food,1,19,4,1,18,0,5.6937321388027
came here for a birthday celebration vibes of the place absolutely lovely and highly recommend the duck and pork plating was gorgeous as well ordered a cocktail to share amongst people which was more than sufficient however we ordered the steak and were not so impressed as it was a little tough and dry despite it being medium rare and rare however staff were apologetic and ready to replace the steaks on the house we were very impressed by the service and will definitely be back again to try other things on the menu and the drinks,1,9,1,0,2,0,4.584967478670572

a lovely little italian we arrived without a booking and managed to get a seat but i recommend booking beforehand to ensure you get a spot as there are n t many tables at this restaurant the staff are welcoming although we did feel a little rushed to order the food took quite a while but it was delicious when it arrived we had a white pizza essentially cheesy garlic bread i had salmon fettuccine and partner had a creamy marinara seafood spaghetti they were well presented and well cooked for me personally a little too much lemon used in my dish but by no means made it unpleasant we also had a couple of glasses of red wine which was really nice the atmosphere was lively and inviting as well as eating in they offer takeaway and there was a steady stream of customers coming in to collect orders in the hour and mins or so that we were there so it obviously a popular spot toilets are out the back of the restaurant which felt a little strange to get to you go through a door from the main restaurant and into a sort of courtyard where there a lot of restaurant items but the facilities were clean and well kept i recommend to go here lovely food and atmosphere and relatively well priced,1,17,3,1,12,0,5.424950017481403

decorated with a profusion of flowers both real and fake the cafe toscana in forster must be one of the most cheerful looking establishments in australia once you step inside the service is friendly and attentive and nothing seems to be a problem i feel kind of mean only giving them stars but there was just something that was n t quite right apart from the overwhelming clutter that passes for decor we really enjoyed our meal choosing items from the smaller tapas menu and a salad instead of having a main the chili mussels were kind of small and did n t quite make it to perfect level despite a tasty and nicely hot sauce the arancini balls were smushy inside instead of distinctly risotto like the garlic prawns were to die for tender plump huge and tasty but the thing that really intrigued me was the salad which was bean heads of broccoli and peas a quick read of the menu seemed to indicate that these three are the only green vegetables the chef knows how to prepare they appeared on the other menu options as my hubby says broccoli and peas must have been cheap this there was nothing wrong exactly all the food was tasty and well presented there was just something undefinable missing but do n t get me wrong the toscana is busy and popular and it did n t disappoint it is definitely worth a visit,1,14,7,0,7,0,5.497168225293202

ordered a mini value range pizza for collection staff were happy to custom make it without a couple of ingredients as i requested when i entered the store the staff ignored me for about minutes plus their usual customer facing screen that shows yr order what stage it is at was offline so i had no idea if it was made or not eventually after serving another collecting customer not speaking to or looking at me before or during that interaction they found my order which had been sitting on a warming plate for the whole time i waited if they were so short staffed they had to make pizzas rather than serve a simple sorry we will be right with you wld have gone a long way instead of making me feel like i was invisible luckily the pizza was delicious,0,6,4,1,11,0,4.962844630259907

while the food undoubtedly stole the show i must admit that the service experience at hogs breath left a bit to be desired however it is essential to highlight that this in no way overshadowed the overall positive experience the servers were friendly and polite but at times it seemed as though they were stretched thin resulting in slightly longer wait times and occasional lapses in attention with a little more attention to detail and the addition of more staff members i am confident that the service could be improved significantly,1,7,1,1,2,0,4.5217885770490405
we quite enjoyed our lunch at benton the only letdown was the rice in the rolls over cooked and under seasoned other than that the benton the other mains were all pretty tasty and well presented pricing was reasonable for the quality and size service was quick and helpful we will probably go back next to we are in the area,1,4,0,0,4,0,4.127134385045092

we came here for dinner on a weeknight the restaurant had a lovely ambiance and service was efficient we ordered the crispy eggplant fried chicken and pork ribs to share the crispy eggplant was a nice starter and beautifully crisp on the outside the pork ribs were also delicious and tender the only let down was the fried chicken dish as it was n t very crispy and somewhat soggy and lacking flavour,1,6,0,0,2,0,4.30406509320417

i try to only write reviews when the food and place is great sadly this is not the case with our experience at frigg in nerang i review only in the hope that lessons are learnt as we really value having a local shop such as frigg in our midst and the potential is there the staff were friendly and cheerful just what you need to start the day there were few people in when we were but our wait for meals was long mins the tea came in a plunger set up but the plunger had been put down so the tea was weak as tap water the poached eggs were badly over cooked the toast was bread basically the hash brown was miniscule and was cold i mean we were not going to die but come on basic stuff i would think we probably will return as i said we need places in nerang but i will be checking future reviews to ensure the issues i mention are not a recurring theme,0,6,4,0,16,0,5.1647859739235145

heard this was rockhampton high end dining but ended up very disappointed sure similarly expensive to nearby restaurants and similarly substandard too not sure whether they are trying to go fine dining family orientated or small business like they fail in any category food is not terrible in fact it was n t bad by my taste still far far below my expectations for what i was told was fine dining some elements did not seem very freshly made summing poor quality control served by a very polite waitress who tried her best and i can appreciate that not tablecloth but you can not try themselves for not being trained the atmosphere is terrible i almost thought to call it rustic but that is simply trying to reframe outdated and worn out other diners were not the type with etiquette who looked like they were deciding between here and a cheap substitute t shirts and sports shorts mainly or walking down from the hotel in slides overrated and overpriced,0,8,7,0,6,0,5.135798437050262

grat decor cute booths menu looks good would advise when ordering to ask them not to put sauce on anything but in a side dish two of us eating one will literally enjoy almost anything he is fed and neither of us really liked any of what we ordered because of the sauce the mushrooms prawns and fried chicken all had this sauce that had a golden syrup type flavour it is a real shame because the mushrooms were incredible as were the prawns but they were ruined by the sauce we were going to stay for a main but we are nervous that sauce would be on the main as well it was n t on the gyozas and they were absolutely lovely but again the sauce it did come with was a little odd edamame was underdone would have given five stars except for that strange sauce it all looked delicious too,1,7,5,0,5,0,5.043425116919247

we had a great time our party host was fantastic the party room can get a little overwhelming and would be great to have the middle wall closed when so many parties are happening we booked a late session on saturday as we were advised that would be the best time of day with a few children having sensory issues and were told we likely have to room to ourselves there was a lot of parties on i think it would be a great idea to stagger the times each party are in eating and having cake my son had to get out of the room as soon as his cake was done as the noise from the neighbouring party was very overwhelming with popping balloons shouting screaming apart from this i would recommend a party at time zone eva was amazing and the party was great value,1,17,1,0,8,0,5.003946305945459
this outlet is in the same location as the now defunct tg thai was located in convenient location at red edge no issues with parking food bir style curry that is prevalent in australia standard curry base which is built upon to order beef bhuna with garlic naan the flavour profile of the bhuna was quite good heat was on point and well spiced texturally sound as well i dislike overly smooth gravies which this fortunately is n t cumin forward on the flavour profile quite dominant whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet bhuna is a dry curry and i wish it was n t served drowned in gravy maybe this is what other customers prefer i like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid the naan was a little disappointing lacking the smoky tandoor flavour i am used to and there was n t a pronounced garlic flavour service absolutely lovely both the lady serving and the gentleman in the kitchen were smiling and welcoming atmosphere what i would expect for a small indian outlet clean and well attended to,1,10,4,1,5,0,5.220355825078324

with all the comments about it is pricey miss the fact that it is a quality burger being able to choose your own toppings is what differentiates this experience however the underrated star of the show is their hotdog and fries real potatoes and the cheese dog is exactly what a hot dog should taste like i will go back just for the dog and fries shakes were delicious,1,2,1,0,2,0,4.248495242049359

unfortunately the happy service was not enough to make up for the food for the seafood basket for was a little over the top the fish were only half sized and everything except the chips were overcooked the prawn cutlets and calamari rings crunched because they were that dry you could taste the oil not the flavour of the food even the lemon was dry it was really disappointing i hang out for fresh fish to eat near the ocean,0,3,2,0,2,0,4.394449154672439
was worried as i waited reading other reviews but am very pleased to say that we had two really good pizzas we had the cheese pizza and pepperoni fantastic amount of toppings and we ordered the biggest size monster and they were actually huge too hungry could n t wait to get the photo would n t hesitate to eat here again,1,4,2,0,4,0,4.143134726391533
good options a lot of good price points some bad my partner spent on a bacon egg muffin great quality i spent on eggs benny but did n t think it was worth it the hash brown was extra maybe the juice was sensational for the essential juice which is great in comparison to most places lovely service too,1,6,1,0,2,0,4.0943445622221
for something different i thought i would order a hotdog instead of a burger big mistake this thing was a cheap as cheap can be gourmet hotdog mexican dog my foot it had bean a couple bits of corn and a dirty boiled hotdog you get in a pack from woollies and the roll was not much better and not even warmed very disappointing for the only saving grace for this place was the loaded chicken fries were nice same with the onion ring if your expecting something awesome move on,0,5,3,0,5,0,4.5217885770490405

visited on this cheap tuesday during our brief stay in wagga after seeing all the good reviews there were only two varieties of pies left as we arrived an hour and a half before closing and both were delicious and affordably priced at each with free sauce be warned though the curry pie has a spicy kick the girls who served us were also lovely i would n t hesitate to come back here next time i in wagga,1,4,2,0,5,0,4.382026634673881
we had a blast at max on hardware for dinner on a bustling public holiday got ta give props to the staff for squeezing us in when every table was taken this spot gets crazy busy but trust me it is worth it the food is delicious portions are huge and prices are reasonable plus the vibe is super chill and when there is a busker jamming outside while you are dining al fresco it takes the experience to a whole new level,1,6,1,0,4,0,4.430816798843313

prime location so expect to pay for it it is essentially two linked experiences the bar and then the restaurant trendy stylish bar area with happy hour and live music attracting the trendy crowd with good atmosphere and wide drinks selection we had some small bites in the restaurant which were ok the chicken karaage was a little overcooked with a little bit too crunchy exterior but the rest was alright,1,5,1,0,1,0,4.276666119016055
ordered way too much everything on the menu looked so good so had to order as much as my eyes could eat did a couple of tacos fried chicken and the corn tacos were the definite stand out for me especially the fish tacos which were crispy fried and delicious not normally big on eating corn but this was pretty good had some special sauce on the plate with this so paired well the fried chicken was ok by this time i was extremely full already this is a schnitzel style fried chicken which also has that same special sauce sauce definitely helped as some of the chicken was slightly dry overall with the sauce it was bearable this place also has a few tables outdoor for seating however not much of a view right next to the road,1,10,0,0,3,0,4.941642422609304

found this cafe through google reviews and it was a nice quiet cafe to enjoy a stop on our way to canberra there are flashier cafes along the strip if that to your tastes but this lovely family run cafe produced good coffees they gave us complimentary mini blueberry muffins today with our coffees and there is a reasonable menu for adults and children did n t get to take many photos but the highlight was the crispy chicken burger which i did get a photo of note that there was a high chair for young children but toilets are located in the plaza down the road up a ramp which has a parents room about a min walk,1,6,1,0,5,0,4.787491742782046

wow what an experience more than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown no greeting or instructions so we grabbed our own table and waited fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table menu collected and choices decided went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive underwhelming at best packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread a request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain again i should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently bacon was ordinary hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect hence the two stars one for each egg do yourself a favour go around the block and take advantage of maccas or hungry jacks at least you know what you will get there,0,9,4,1,11,0,5.429345628954441

i really wanted to give this place higher rating but unfortunately could n t find a good enough reason to starting with the positive prices are super competitive most dishes are under however moving to the negative dishes are on the small side my kids and wife not big eaters asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry we also felt quality of food could have been much better a few examples the cinnamon toast was flooded with butter we could n t finish it poached eggs on the benedict were over cooked like hard boiled egg dishes were all super basic in execution an average home cook could have easily done a better job to top it all we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies i reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that it much more than small nuisance,0,11,4,0,7,0,5.049856007249537
we have stayed at the hotel several times over the last years and unfortunately this time was the worst and as such we will not return in the future the pool was not heated and whilst it was open was not tolerable due to the intense cold temperature i noted only a couple of kids who braved the water whilst we were there we did try and lasted only a couple of minutes we deliberately booked the hotel due to the indoor heated pool over an airbnb house as we both have medical conditions in which we need to regularly rehab in the pool the one time we did brave it we were in more pain when we got out additionally the bar fridge made so much noice that at night we slept with the tv on to drown out the noise of the fridge our room was cleaned daily however was not vacuumed the entire time we were there as dirt on the carpet was there when we arrived and there when we left overall a very disappointing experience i do n t believe the standard of room service matched the price of the room we paid for,0,3,6,0,18,0,5.298317366548036

it is not the best kebabs in the world but it is the best in dalby for sure for some reason every kebab shop here wraps their kebabs in foil before pressing them which means the actual tortilla wrap part does n t get cooked and seal shut properly so they can fall apart on you if you are not careful when eating them however ace uses thicker tortilla wraps so they do hold together better than other places in dalby however i do miss the real good kebabs from other towns where they get pressed first and then put in packaging so the kebab is actually cooked and sealed shut still i love kebabs so i tolerate it here and as i said ace is the best you will get in dalby,1,8,1,0,7,0,4.897839799950911

stopped in for lunch and was pleased with a tasty lunch no issues with anything seated and ordered quickly the kitchen was able to accommodate a few requests and everything came out promptly we ordered the steamed barramundi crispy pork belly and broccoli and chili basil fried rice with crispy pork belly everything was delicious and portioned well nothing felt overly heavy or unhealthy as stir frys sometimes can overall i would definitely go back and next time go for the lunch specials,1,4,3,1,2,0,4.430816798843313
the pasta was delicious we ordered the alfredo with fettuccine and the prawn pesto fettuccine it was creamy delicious and perfectly seasoned the pasta came with slices of bread each and some parmesan grated ontop the chili oil that is offered at the table was absolutely delicious on the bread if you were kind of hungry then then this pasta would fill you up but if you were starving then you would need a nd meal to fill you up i also ordered the triffle oil pizza it was just ok i would never order it again far too plain and boring the customer service was excellent the only issue i noticed throughout the night was that everyone in the restaurant that had ordered pizza was waiting for their meals for a while which was really annoying because most people came with their partners so whoever ordered pasta would get that first and then whoever ordered pizza would get it mins later which defeats the purpose of eating together at a restaurant meals should always be served at the same time the drinks were really nice we ordered lemon lime bitters and pink lemonade,1,8,5,0,10,0,5.272999558563747

my take away from my visit to this museum that stands on the site of the first governor house that was built by governor phillip the first governor of sydney and the man that led the first ships to bring convicts over from england is this if every other governor and leader had behaved like governor phillip to the indigenous people then we would have avoided much of the pains that followed in the colonisation of this island a beautiful museum and a great place to go to get a good introduction to the history of sydney and indeed the birth of australia and it is free and has a good coffee shop cafe,1,6,2,0,3,0,4.74493212836325

the food here is decent and so is the environment generally everything i had here has been good but in this review i be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day the prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than i prefer personally i like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour but that just me the prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though the steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked the meat was n t as warm as i liked and the caramelised onions were n t as flavoursome as they looked to be overall you could n t taste much else and the sandwich i think was only half a sandwich would have liked the whole thing for that price the chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain tasted like there was n t any seasoning at all on them a jug of lemon lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better will have to write another review the next time i visit,1,14,1,0,9,0,5.267858159063328

the new renovations have certainly lightened the mood of the dining rooms we enjoyed our entrees more than our mains likely because the prices seemed to be right for the entrees whereas the mains were a bit more pricey than we felt was appropriate compared to other similar options in and around the mount very good customer service and the location is easily accessed plenty of parking between the mac and the public library robert helpmann theatre,1,4,0,0,4,0,4.356708826689592
we got giovanne pizza portofino pizza and garlic prawn pasta the pizzas were really good nice and tasty plenty of toppings and crust was n t too thick pasta however was far too oily see attached photo and the pasta itself was extremely bland the bacon on the other hand was too salty bad pairing of flavours this dish needs maybe pesto or some other flavour to tie it together manager was more than happy to take the pasta off our bill which was very generous of him environment and service i can not fault just the pasta was a let down,0,5,2,0,3,0,4.634728988229636

it was my first time to come and try the foods in here it was recommended by my friend i was very impressed with the taste and quality of the foods especially nasi goreng and the pork belly babi guling i am relieved that they served like this food in a sports bar honestly i was n t expecting it we loved the grilled lamb skewers too we will definitely come back next time,1,8,0,0,7,0,4.31748811353631
told foh staff that we got overcooked poached egg after checking with the kitchen team she informed us that they can not do anything as the entire meal is half eaten already lesson learned check the egg first before start eating anything on the plate then found blue plastic on my chicken meat pie this time they replaced it with a new one and returned my money back unfortunately the second meat pie still has the blue plastic inside the filling unsure if this just my unluckiest day or well at least they played my fav song during the entire time i was there,0,3,2,0,7,0,4.653960350157523
returning to this restaurant for a second time i was once again reminded of why it left such a strong impression initially the overall experience was fantastic with the ambiance being particularly enjoyable and the food maintaining its exceptional standard while the service did n t quite hit the five star mark this time around it was n t enough to detract from the high quality of the dining experience every dish that we ordered was outstanding the beef cheeks deserve a special mention for being absolutely perfect a testament to the skill and care in the kitchen despite the slight dip in service my anticipation for another visit remains undiminished this restaurant continues to be a place where the food speaks volumes and i eagerly look forward to enjoying what they have to offer in the future,1,11,0,0,4,0,4.9344739331306915
tried their folded chili eggs plus mushrooms and bacon each if i did not add the mushrooms and bacon it is rather a simple overpriced chili eggs on an almost soggy bread but with more flavours and protein in the mix it was a good dish overall minus the price point coffee was spot on a little coffee art may help esp for weekend brunches after a long workweek might be of a stretch for a suggestion i know this is usual in melbourne though service was fantastic staff were friendly and attentive,1,4,0,0,2,0,4.543294782270004
good beer nice garlic bread did n t call last drinks or give any sign of drinks ending stopped serving beer minutes early and made us feel awkward and uncomfortable firstly they turned the music up so loud we had to shout at each other then stopped the music completely mopped around us turned off their tills and stared at the remaining patrons until we left minutes prior to their advertised closing time on a friday night of the bundaberg beer festival weekend overall a disappointing experience we were really excited to visit we are visiting from melbourne so this was our only chance to visit,0,5,5,0,7,0,4.672828834461906
what a gem on recommendation from friends went there for a mother day lunch with the fam fresh and tasty with flavor and spice to send your tastebuds zinging great size servings and complexity of flavor and texture in every dish ordered a freshly squeezed sugarcain juice to soothe the delicious spicy punch i could imagine a splash of white rum in that would be dang fine a decent atmosphere in an unexpected place it is on the return list for sure,1,7,0,0,2,0,4.418840607796598
i absolutely do not recommend staying here the whole place needs gutted and redone absolutely filthy and very run down apparently there was a flood recently so there is a bad smell a bit like urine there are currently roadworks going on just outside the hostel during the entire night and they were so loud i barely got any sleep whilst this is n t the hostels fault they make no effort to even warn you about this as i would have tried to get to sleep before the roadworks began if warned they could also do things like offer free earplugs i had my own but this feels like bare minimum you can still hear the roadworks clearly through them or just acknowledge it in some way windows are also not fit for purpose so do nothing to reduce the noise lots of people seemed like they were living there so not great for solo travellers looking to meet people to do activities with only saving grace is location and the staff were nice,0,11,5,1,7,0,5.170483995038151

i went here for breakfast this morning and was so pleasantly surprised they were n t allowing dine in so i got pancakes to take away for two huge pancakes with berries and maple syrup for c not bad at all the only problem was that they were slightly undercooked kind of spongey which i fully believed was due to the rush but they tasted amazing the berries were fresh and delicious i also bought a coffee kind of expensive coffee but that is likely where they get most of their income as it is a coffee place so completely understandable quite possibly the best cappuccino i have ever had will one hundred percent return i would like to see more gluten free and dairy free options so that i can bring my dietary restricted friends along,1,13,3,0,8,0,4.927253685157205

i recently visited butter factory and unfortunately my experience was quite disappointing especially with regards to the korean chicken and lemon squid dishes korean chicken the korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors i was expecting the seasoning was bland and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as i had hoped for it seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature korean chicken taste lemon squid the lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations the squid was overcooked resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy additionally the lemon sauce lacked balance being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out pricing and portions one of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at butter factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes the dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served the portions were notably small leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent overall while the ambiance of butter factory was pleasant the food quality particularly the korean chicken and lemon squid dishes did not meet expectations the pricing coupled with the small portions further detracted from the overall dining experience i hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers,0,12,5,0,7,0,5.455321115357702

the jade house in geraldton is quite nice the staff are extremely polite and helpful the decor lacks a bit of ambience but it is very clean the menu is quite extensive with a good array of dishes to choose from and the waiting time for the food is very reasonable while most of the food was really delicious i was disappointed with the prawn toast and the fried rice the combination fried rice lacked ingredients and flavour and the prawn toast was over cooked and too dry however given this is geraldton the jade house chinese restaurant is one of the better places to dine in,1,6,1,0,1,0,4.68213122712422

my brother took me here for lunch which was nice of him our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was it took men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope once inside the waitress seated us at our table which was in the middle of the room this would n t be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant aside from some rando in shorts at the bar who left soon after the decor is nice the waitress served our table water took our orders then went and made our drinks the food seemed to take a while which i thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve us i guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever no complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came top tier served and presented well and tasted better than it looked about the best a bundy bogan can ask for the waitress serving us the only waitress there also made our cocktails she took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered which as somewhat of a mixologist myself i could appreciate overall i had a pleasant dining experience and i would definitely come here again on someone else money between entrees mains and drinks we racked up although we were given back in change for some unknown reason it was really mysterious another mystery was what was upstairs they had chairs parked in front so you could n t easily get up there but i think next time i will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding,1,13,4,1,22,0,5.666426688112432
it convenience over quality it a great concept and i like the idea of being more lazy but the pies were mediocre and the toasties were stale i would stick to beechworth bakery or skipton bakery in ballarat as they make their stuff in the morning or on the day whereas this place looks like they freeze it and just heat it up,0,4,1,0,2,0,4.1588830833596715

a beautifully styled space with the fun of a sushi train offering a continuous stream of sushi and other dishes we had takeaway which was quite nice the staff member who served me was polite and friendly though a little too optimistic about the wait time the overall experience could have been improved by more careful attention to detail in the sushi work neatness and precision and consideration to the packaging paper bags in a plastic carry bag made for some slightly squashed sushi rolls also the layout of the shop entrance is awkward as the open door blocks the takeaway counter requiring lots of polite shuffling of people whenever a customer enters would like to return for the dine in sushi train experience,1,9,2,0,2,0,4.8283137373023015

arrived for our booking for to find the table so hard against sides it was impossible to get in or out from your seat after talking to the staff no help was given so we adjusted the arrangement ourselves the eftpos system is confusing as it requests a tip prior to taking your payment leaving some of our party being confronted at the table for not paying for drinks change your system and earn a tip this would be impossible for the bald guy who seems to be the manager he has zero personality does not understand hospitality and ca n t pour a beer he single pours the beer over the top of the rim no head they look flat and dead when i asked for this to be rectified he emptied the glass partially out shook it and then aggressively refilled them i did not accept this and asked for him to report them properly he did do this but made it very clear he had the apart from that the food was tasty however the scales in the kitchen do not work for the advertised steak portion,0,5,9,1,8,0,5.25227342804663

positives first time going to this place today let me tell you coming from a family of chefs this was delectable the dine in meals came out fast they were large portions and very good temperature we ordered the flowered onion fried and whole we ordered the louisiana chook both entrees then i had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg the mash and veg was perfectly cooked though the mash tastes a little like packet mash the sauce with the louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n t tolerate a little spice the sauce is n t for you but man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible was thoroughly enjoyable the parmigiana was large so much so i could n t finish it all great that they gave takeaways negatives the drink i ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section tasted great only issue i really had was the lemon seeds in the drink lucky the straws were n t big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink we loved the louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in specifically regarding our dining experience we also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu the churros are exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it but the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite the sauce also tasted store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking the flowered onion leaves much to be desired for i definitely would n t eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up the sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal other i must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay just did n t really get time to savour the entrees the serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating also incase anyone wants to know they have the mccs discounts for marines over all my dining experience was fantastic just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes and the wait for takeaway was much longer than the wait for the main meal taste for those specific meals besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar was great will definitely bring my husband and other family here again,1,21,7,1,24,0,6.154858094016418

i reserved a table and made a special note when booking that it was for a birthday they also advertise that you get a great seat and free chocolate etc none of this was realized at all we had the table right at the entrance which was not a great place at all and there was no other attention to the birthday why do you promote this and yet is implemented when the food arrived we were disappointed once again my partner ordered the steak medium rare and got a steak well done in a steak restaurant you expect that the cooking levels should n t be a problem and that they know their way around he had to give the meat back and i had to eat it once because otherwise it got cold great to celebrate a birthday in the restaurant and i ca n t even eat with my partner at the same time then his food arrived when i had almost finished eating and the meat was only cooked medium absolute disappointment dessert when we got the dessert menu we had to wait over minutes to be able to order we then got fed up and got up and paid without ordering dessert we have been to various steak restaurants all over the world but we definitely would n t go to this one again the food was ok but there is definitely better,0,12,4,1,16,0,5.476463551931511

second time ordering from this place i was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something i usually order from other restaurants sauce and bread were good but there were only small bite sized pieces of chicken i payed dollars uber excl service delivery for this dish and it quite disappointing feels like i bought sauce and bread not chicken called the owner to make sure it was n t a mistake was told small pieces off the skewer was the standard i shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken that he does n t make his money from butter chicken anyway if you not making money from butter chicken and do n t want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu also pretty sure i can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast thigh you have people who would love to support you it would be great if you were more open to customer feedback after looking at the reviews i can see there are many who had this issue for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough wo nt be back as there are other places more generous with the serving all the best,0,15,3,0,13,0,5.5134287461649825
this place used to do amazing afghan naan but now the quality and weight of naan has dropped naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns this business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan one line of one pack and another line for more than one pack which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line they need to adopt a number serving system soon i think lot of fighting happening there during weekends hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,0,7,2,0,1,0,4.812184355372417

an institution on hardware lane specialising in hanoiese style vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients no message and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over yrs northern vietnamese pho is very different to their southern counterparts and i believe this place is as authentic as you will get in the cbd both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth perfectly cooked noodles and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments there are no bean sprouts because there are n t supposed to be bean sprouts that is a southern thing northern pho is not complicated and has no frills be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion pho thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be message free makes it a clear broth winner my only qualm is that the donut was n t the best one i have had it needed to be crispier and not as dense and maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho definitely order one per bowl it is not a sharing serving size at all,1,10,3,1,6,0,5.214935757608986

i recently visited al baik fried chicken restaurant and overall i had a satisfying experience the fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of kfc which is quite an accomplishment the crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat however i must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired it was adequate but i would rate it out of perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere one aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers which they had posted on social media i was looking forward to trying those deals but unfortunately they were not available during my visit on the positive side the service was prompt and the staff was courteous and attentive they made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant the tables and chairs were well maintained and the washrooms were spotless in conclusion al baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with kfc although the ambience could use some improvement the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it i hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future,0,19,3,0,11,0,5.37989735354046

a flavorful culinary experience with a few salty surprises i recently dined at spice garden restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing the ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon making it a pleasant dining experience for starters the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit the perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out the steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well prepared showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites moving on to the main course the spice garden non veg platter was a generous assortment of flavors however i must mention that the chicken changezi and malai soya chaap were a bit on the salty side which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes it would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience the bread basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal offering a variety of textures and tastes despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes the overall food quality was commendable the service was too slow and un attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course the restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family in conclusion spice garden restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere i recommend trying their starters especially the chilli momos and prawns while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience,1,19,2,0,4,0,5.7745515455444085

the restaurant location next to padav brij is decent but our dining experience left much to be desired while the restaurant boasts a flashy ambiance what matters most to customers is food quality quantity and taste all of which were compromised here we initially tried to order hyderabadi biryani only to be told it was n t available which was puzzling for a dinner item during dinner hours we settled for the chilli paneer fried rice combo and cold coffee which set us back rupees an amount that seemed excessive given the meager portions we received unfortunately when our order arrived it felt like they had reheated a frozen dish in the oven for five minutes as the fried rice lacked freshness taste wise you can find similar options at more affordable prices elsewhere in gwalior,0,3,1,0,7,0,4.919980925828125

this was once a best theatre around this region but right now it is not upto the mark it badly needs renovation i have been visiting this theatre since childhood and it was good until years back after then there were lots of things that felt like should be improved the sound quality is really poor and inside the theatre and there are literally spiderwebs on the walls there is another theatre in town run by the same management called sathiyan cinemas where the sound quality is much better than pandian this theatre really has scope to get improved but has not made any improvements recently the snacks inside this theatre is not that much great you get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips popcorn and egg puffs when you but tickets online you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall this is literally so outdated management technique if you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets also for buying snacks there is no upi payment option so regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in the cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark this theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it considering the improvements of cinema experience in many other towns like karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better but feels like they refuse to do so other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen recently watched manjummel boys and had this experience the air conditioning system is really good in this theatre if someone from the theatre management sees this review kindly take them into consideration and please make improvements thanks,0,20,5,1,9,0,5.8664680569332965

it looks good at first then slowly the flaws start to become apparent making something good is a good thing but maintaining it for a long time is a different thing the way premium nature has been given to the place the staff does not know how to handle it the staff does a lot of abnormal things which compromises the quality of your place the manner of your staff coming and using the customer chairs and sofa does not look good their way of talking way of walking dressing makes the place normal and in the end the very bad thing hand marks were visible on the mirror of the entrance door and at the place did not feel fresh at all it looked a bit dirty which is a bad thing for a cafe the burger was very tasteless as per the price and no attempt was made to clean the wooden pan which is necessary to clean once it is given to a customer so that the other person can see the cleanliness very unprofessional work you have created a good place and i hope that your service brings a change in your place and gives a fresh and good vibe to the customers,0,13,5,1,6,0,5.337538079701318

the valley of kashmir has unique geographical features being home to the rarest of natural beauties kashmir hosts some of the most wondrous places in the world when we think of kashmir the first thing we visualise is the beautiful shikaras in dal lake the exquisite mughal gardens the cascading shrunz and aharbal waterfalls the magical betaab valley the stunning sonamarg and the glorious gulmarg true kashmir being one absolute jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet one among them is chattabal surrounded with serene himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir chattabal of chitergul shangus area is just km from district anantnag and merely km away from the famous mughal garden of achabal situated in the lap of pir panjal mountains chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about not many people go in that direction primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in anantnag the majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from anantnag or any of the nearby villages the valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature the vast green plains look like natural tapestries as if spread by divine hands it has two routes through which people can reach the place one is from shangus road and the second is from kp kehribal,1,14,0,0,4,0,5.5254529391317835

hordes of people a wall like rack lined with packets of bread that is the way to spot madhuram sandwich situated diagonally opposite to the famous kaanch mandir this small shop is indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers it sells unexpectedly good generously layered with paneer cubes capsicum onion cucumber and some tandoori mayo these sandwiches are huge it would n t be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich served with coriander chutney ketchup and potato wafers the sandwich is liberally topped with sev jeeravan mayo and cheese the perfect combination for indori taste buds in short a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two trust me it is true for me even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult so if you plan on having this sandwich make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n t plan to order anything else because you wo n t be able to eat anything after the sandwich with just bench tables to sit on and tiny tables to stand and eat the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers a lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n t like sitting on the street side to eat the best part this enormous sandwich is priced at rs only and reaches you in just mins is n t it wow light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well check out madhuram sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy enjoy,1,19,2,0,11,0,5.594711379601839
