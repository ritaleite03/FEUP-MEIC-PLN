Good beer, nice garlic bread. Did n't call last drinks or give any sign of drinks ending. Stopped serving beer 45 minutes early and made us feel awkward and uncomfortable.

No its more about risk management, why accept a small % more to run the risk that an inspection might find something unforeseen and your sale falls through when u can accept a little less for an unconditional sale.

The funghi aranchini was spot on and so was the calamari fritto. The main course were a bit of a let down. The pizza( Fiorentina) tasted like something from a supermarket.

We tried Simply Veg Pizza for 100 & Americana Crisp Sandwhich( grilled) but it was full of mayonnaise which I genuinely did n’t like it that much. I would recommend trying veg pizza.

Entering as a walk in, the venue was very accommodating and were able to find a table for two very quickly. We were provided with drinks also very quickly which was very good service. The service was the highlight of this visit. The low rating is due to the food. We ordered a seafood vongole and a seafood risotto with a side of truffle fries and tenderstem broccoli. The brocoli and the fries were lovely but we were both deeply disappointed with our main dishes. Both were bland, lacked seasoning, and neither tasted of seafood. We found ourselves prioritising the brocoli and fries which was noted by the attentive staff. How a plate of clams and pasta can taste of nothing was beyond my imagination for such a highly rated restaurant. | enter walk venue accommodate able find table two quickly provide drink also quickly good service service highlight visit low rating due food order seafood vongole seafood risotto side truffle fry tenderstem broccoli brocoli fry lovely deeply disappointed main dish bland lack season neither taste seafood find prioritise brocoli fry note attentive staff plate clam pasta taste nothing beyond imagination highly rat restaurant | 0 | 1

LCD backlights have an expected lifespan, typically measured in hours. It can be a pretty wide range of hours from 20,000 - 100,000 hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components, screen brightness & other settings, environment it was being used in, so on and so forth. Some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans (with lots of caveats).

How many hours per day did you use the monitor? What brightness level? Was the room it was in hot or humid? Did it get direct sunlight? Etc etc etc.  Multiply the amount of hours you used it by 4 years, take off a bunch for whatever conditions, and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor, then you can argue (per Australin consumer law) that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it isn't meeting the expected lifespan.

But if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor, you're going to have a much harder time arguing that point. | lcd backlights expect lifespan typically measured hour pretty wide range hour hour depend multiple thing quality component screen brightness setting environment use forth manufacturer advertise expect lifespan lot caveat many hour per day use monitor brightness level room hot humid get direct sunlight etc etc etc multiply amount hour use year take bunch whatever condition number get significantly expect lifespan monitor argue per australin consumer law despite warranty still valid return not meet expect lifespan rough estimate total hour use around expect monitor go much hard time argue point | 1 | 0

I dropped out of my science degree, so I'm personally a bad example LOL. But because I was part of a Science cohort, and now work at the uni I dropped out of, I happen to have a lot of Science uni friends. 

I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 

Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.

My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 

My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 

A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD). | drop science degree personally bad example lol part science cohort work uni drop happen lot science uni friend say no one make big buck not know anyone astrophysics though know handful phd student field relatively prestigious university undergraduate participate institutional research project prior phd anecdotal story friends science grad best friend double degree chemistry commerce always smart hardworking work sydney water salary k partner forensic science major skill lean towards chemistry tell first year date year old not go find job field impossible field science get unless want get mess join police get transfer science role since one university pathology lab pay pretty bad though k work night shift job not stressful not career ambitious handful friend work lab research assistant full time equivelent salary k not able get full time ongoing employment ok research master think phd | 1 | 0

While the food undoubtedly stole the show, I must admit that the service experience at Hogs Breath left a bit to be desired. However, it is essential to highlight that this in no way overshadowed the overall positive experience. The servers were friendly and polite, but at times it seemed as though they were stretched thin, resulting in slightly longer wait times and occasional lapses in attention. With a little more attention to detail and the addition of more staff members, I am confident that the service could be improved significantly. | food undoubtedly steal show must admit service experience hog breath leave bit desired however essential highlight no way overshadow overall positive experience server friendly polite time seem though stretch thin result slightly longer wait time occasional lapse attention little attention detail addition staff member confident service could improve significantly | 1 | 0

This cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around! Less than 6 per person, even when booking our tickets online. My husband and I went at the end of March. I have a disability, so arrived a little earlier to allow time to get from the nearby car park to the cinema, as there is no parking outside the building. The lift is quite hidden and easily missed. It was rather old looking, much like the rest of the cinema, and very, very slow going both up and down. Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small. Sadly, most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby, though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability I managed a 2hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting, which is good for me. Despite the few negative points, I will definitely come again, mainly due to how close it is to my home and the fact that it does n't cost us an arm and a leg!! | cinema one cheapest cinema around less per person even book ticket online husband go end march disability arrive little earlier allow time get nearby car park cinema no parking outside build lift quite hidden easily miss rather old look much like rest cinema slow go anyone n t like lift much probably not like one also rather small sadly cinema decor look old rather shabby though seat small cinema quite comfortable despite disability manage hr screen without much discomfort fidget good despite negative point definitely come mainly due close home fact n t cost u arm leg | 1 | 0

We got # 13( Giovanne) pizza, # 28( Portofino) pizza and Garlic Prawn Pasta. The pizzas were really good. Nice and tasty, plenty of toppings and crust was n't too thick. Pasta however was far too oily( see attached photo) and the pasta itself was extremely bland. The bacon on the other hand was too salty. Bad pairing of flavours.

Ridiculously overpriced food-you can get better at KFC for less. Was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at Wingstop sounded very tasty on the board. I ordered the box of 8 boneless chicken, fries with the Wingstop flavoring and a drink. What was served up however, was mediocre, the chicken was just warm and did n't contain much sauce on them. In the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring-mine arrived with a dash of flavour. I do have to say the Brazilian and Mango Habanero sauces were good though. The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again. If I ever did venture in again, perhaps I'd try a burger. | ridiculously overprice food get good kfc less look forward try something different norm chicken marinade selection wingstop sound tasty board order box boneless chicken fry wingstop flavor drink serve however mediocre chicken warm n t contain much sauce advert pic chicken drench sauce flavour mine arrive dash flavour say brazilian mango habanero sauce good though fry wingstop season ok season contain clump sugar n t enjoy much near would n t ever venture perhaps would try burger | 0 | 1

Sydney and Melbourne although it’s pretty ridiculous either way. Literally oranges vs apple type argument. It’s natural though as they’re two of the biggest cities in the country with a similar population. 

NSW vs QLD State of Origin is probably the closest answer and most reasonable. Most people I know that don’t bother watching regular NRL games almost always tune into State of Origin anyways. (Speaking as someone from Sydney) there’s a wholly agreed upon sentiment to hate the other state out of loyalty of their own.

I thoroughly asked the waiter which meals are vegan-got a sandwich and veggie burger with mayonaise. They told me first it's only plant based, no eggs. The manager even showed me the package with the ingredients. It contained milk solids. I had some painful hours afterwards digesting it. Things like that must never happen in a restaurant. The staff should know what they serve-but I assume they mainly serve readymade factory food. The lemon tea taste like instant tea, the fruit shakes are only fruit flavored, no real fruit( according to waiter). If you want to know what you eat, go elsewhere. Only plus: it's a good place to hang out. Comfortable seats and possibiliy to charge your cell phone. | thoroughly ask waiter meal vegan get sandwich veggie burger mayonaise tell first plant base no eggs manager even show package ingredient contain milk solid painful hour afterwards digest thing like must never happen restaurant staff know serve assume mainly serve readymade factory food lemon tea taste like instant tea fruit shake fruit flavor no real fruit accord waiter want know eat go elsewhere plus good place hang comfortable seat possibiliy charge cell phone | 1 | 0

Second visit here as my local cinema and which I also prefer would be showcase cinema due too facilities and personal comfort as my kids enjoy the seatin and space they can have' their for I do n't mind to pay more'.

The food area also needs change as too small, ca n't see much of menu, everything small and crowded, confusing at times as having to ask what's what or what's on offer can get annoying, Also the cinema sound volume needs to be louder then how they have it as you pay to be in a cinema for that expect the experience of being inside one which isint the case here as you can hear everyone around you and can be very uncomfortable to move or eat or trying to open the sweet pack. A big no no! Price on cinema tickets and food is good for everyone I guess, but alot of downside which can be adjusted.

Update: have been a few times now and the food has n't been up scratch. There is always something missing in one of our meals. Latest one was ordering an ultimate burger which was missing the bacon. Went to The White Sawn for lunch. Had to get past people smoking right outside the door. Once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table. We ordered from the app; the drinks and food arrived promptly after. The pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate. It was generously topped as well and tasted good. The fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons. Overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes. The only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance( maybe they should move the smoking area)! | update time food n t scratch always something miss one meal late one order ultimate burger miss bacon go white sawn lunch get past people smoke right outside door inside ample seat manage get nice clean table order app drink food arrive promptly pizza order right size advertise roughly size plate generously top well taste good fish chip also cook well got reasonable portion chip comparison small portion weatherspoons overall good experience fast service good portion size negative prepare go past people sit smoke right entrance maybe move smoke area | 0 | 1

If you want to experience korean food in Barrackpore then you must visit this cafe. The Decor is superb. The seating space is limited and generally packed during weekends. Visit early to get suitable seating space. Perfect place for Anime lovers, Korean drama fans and Harry Potter fans. You get amazing books Collection. You can also buy korean merch from there in house store. Food is AVERAGE. 1) SOJU is non alcoholic. Also you ca n't take away the bottle( Rs.) if you can not finish it. Tastes like appy fizz mixed with Sprite. 2) the Ramen is n't authentic. They use Maggie which is served with deep fried egg and chicken. It's not a korean noodles. The price point is high. Korean fried wings are good. You can give it a try. 3) beverage like-Vietnamese coffee, dalgona coffee, boba tea, is really good. 4) desserts are also worth trying.

A cute corner restaurant that I been wanting to try. Walk by it frequently. Decided to try it. Ordered eggs Florentine. First time I ever had it served with raw spinach. The egg was good. But 11 for a toasted English muffin and 2 eggs with some raw spinach. Ordered a scone with jam and butter. Did n’t realize the butter and jam would cost even more than the scone.

If you change the account password on booking.com, they won’t be able to sign into booking.com  again, which will stop the influx of failed payment Noti emails into your inbox. 

There’s no need to close your email account, really. I’ve had my info in data breaches 6 times in 2013 and I’m still using the same email address, although I’m now using “hide my email” in iOS so it isn’t being put out online anymore. It makes up an random email address when signing up for things and diverts them into my one inbox. If something looks a little suspect, it’s easy to deactivate the fake address and that’s the end of that. Also handy to catch out companies that have sold someone else my info.

The card is old, so that’s sweet. Weird that they tried to use it though. They’d have seen the expiry date and they don’t work very well after the end of the month that it expires in.

A digital number on display is more convenient for staff and patrons. In rush times, you queue for minutes to order. Online ordering would be a great addition to the service. | food okay get good quality branch busy branch hence noise cleanliness issue order number shout bit inconvenient digital number display convenient staff patron rush time queue minute order online order would great addition service | 0 | 1

This was once a best theatre around this region, But right now it is not upto the mark. It badly needs renovation. I have been visiting this theatre since childhood and it was good until 5 years back. After then there were lots of things that felt like should be improved. The sound quality is really poor and inside the theatre and there are literally spiderwebs on the walls. There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian. This theatre really has scope to get improved, but has not made any improvements recently. The snacks inside this theatre is not that much great. You get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips, popcorn and egg puffs. When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience). The Air conditioning system is really good in this theatre. If someone from the theatre management sees this review, kindly take them into consideration and please make improvements. Thanks! | best theatre around region right not upto mark badly need renovation visit theatre since childhood good year back lots thing felt like improve sound quality really poor inside theatre literally spiderwebs wall another theatre town run management call sathiyan cinema sound quality much well pandian theatre really scope get improve not make improvement recently snack inside theatre not much great get old school kind snack like wheel chip popcorn egg puff ticket online still wait counter movie get physical copy ticket get inside cinema hall literally outdated management technique book online go counter soft copy ticket also buy snack no upi payment option regard digital aspect theatre still cleanliness restroom not upto mark theatre badly need consider option make change regard consider improvement cinema experience many town like karaikudi theatre scope make experience much good feel like refuse theatre big screen picture quality good watching language movie might not get see subtitle since zoom crop picture make subtitle go screen recently watch manjummel boy experience air condition system really good theatre someone theatre management see review kindly take consideration please make improvement thanks | 0 | 1

The food was very delicious. There were a lot of people at lunch time, so the waiting time was 20 minutes. They did n't serve us water on the table which we found very irresponsible. Also the cleaning person was just brushing down waste directly to the floor from the table right in front of us. A little more cleanliness can be practiced. | food delicious lot people lunch time wait time minute n t serve u water table find irresponsible also clean person brush waste directly floor table right front u little cleanliness practice | 0 | 1
It's an easy drive done it a heap with my two kids.

My method wss leave at around 4am so you're clear of Newcastle and have zero traffic issues getting out of Sydney. Also so your not tired, after an early night with the car already packed and fueled so your ready to just hit the highway. | easy drive do heap two kid method wss leave around clear newcastle zero traffic issue get sydney also not tire early night car already pack fueled ready hit highway | 1 | 0

Very busy due to school holidays, but could order at the table in this one vs others that ca n’t which make the wait a lot more bearable. We found a seat upstairs so not too bad.

Great Food, but very slow serving takes more than 30 minutes to get food, most annoying is the lady bringing sweet even before sitting properly on chair, no common sense for that lady and pushing to buy sweets which is desert not a starter, should follow common table manners.

The drive itself is interesting if you like long stretches of driving. 

However, I’m not sure it’d be enjoyable or interesting at a slower pace. 

Also there are few to zero interesting towns between Ceduna and Norseman, so that will be a long slog. 

You will also have trucks, road trains and caravaners overtaking you probably too close. Those bigger vehicles push a lot of air when they pass, and you feel it in vehicles like a dual cab, I’d hate to be on something like a postie bike. | drive interest like long stretch drive however not sure would enjoyable interest slow pace also zero interesting town ceduna norseman long slog also truck road train caravaners overtake probably close big vehicle push lot air pas feel vehicle like dual cab would hate something like postie bike | 1 | 0

The physical coal is mostly all locked up in supply contracts, its not like going down to the market for it. What isnt would need to be shipped over there through an active warzone and Australia has no merchant marine - a lot of the $20m would go into transport and insurance.

One of the best Biryani joints in town. Both mutton and chicken biryanis are great. Half plate has good portions. Liked the mutton chap too. Only issue is they run out of the mutton biryani quite fast like by 7 pm. Otherwise would have been a 5 star. Over the years price has increased quite a bit. Maybe they should remove the cheap from the name. They have an AC dining area in the 1st floor but the AC stays off in the " winter "( like every other shop with AC in town) and the windows also stay closed. This makes the dining area very hot, stuffy and stinky. So maybe it's better to dine at the non AC ground floor if you are okay with a bit of dust. I would always recommend to do a takeaway and dine peacefully in your own home. | one best biryani joint town mutton chicken biryani great half plate good portion like mutton chap issue run mutton biryani quite fast like pm otherwise would star year price increase quite bit maybe remove cheap name ac din area st floor ac stay winter like every shop ac town window also stay closed make din area hot stuffy stinky maybe well dine non ac ground floor okay bit dust would always recommend takeaway dine peacefully home | 0 | 1
