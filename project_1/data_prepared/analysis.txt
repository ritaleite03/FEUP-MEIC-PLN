Great location for people travelling via Hammersmith Station, and for those going to a concert at either Shepherd Bush Empire or Eventim Apollo. The room was much smaller than expected, especially in comparison to rooms in other Premier Inns. The curtain in the room also did n’t fully shut out all of the light which was inconvenient now that the sun is rising very early. One out of two lifts was also out of order during the whole stay which made getting to the room, which was on one of the highest levels, take a lot longer than I would liked. | great location people travel via hammersmith station go concert either shepherd bush empire eventim apollo room much small expect especially comparison room premier inns curtain room also n t fully shut light inconvenient sun rise early one two lift also order whole stay make get room one high level take lot long would like | 0 | 1

We popped in to experience London cinema as well and did not regret at all. The chairs are comfy plus double chairs were available in the last row. Screen 4 is tiny as you can see on the video but it gives it a familiar feeling which we liked.

Does anyone know of any places to meet new people? I have an interest in art and it’s been a long time since I’ve done anything art related. Mental health has been bad for over a year and a half.

Sydney and Melbourne although it’s pretty ridiculous either way. Literally oranges vs apple type argument. It’s natural though as they’re two of the biggest cities in the country with a similar population.

It isn't always about a sense of pride.

It is more about the market and what make sense economically.

For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players

Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.

Why?
1) The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.


2) Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.


3) Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost 

Lot of other things as well | not always sense pride market make sense economically example see construction crane material conveyor belt like thing use big company give cost optimisation able compete modernize player whereas go small town people small scale work still use old method new method need lot skill time patience reach level competency require give customer set deliverables financial incentive often large captial expense require make switch small setup may not credit access since demand kind work not reward extra do modern method no incentive risk take ability every new migration come challenge example want small store owner begin track inventory make sale use cloud solution not ready face outage prospect pay security similar upgrade not add much value compare cost lot thing well | 1 | 0

I was really excited about going here as it seemed very cute. We were sat at the bar where the stools mad you too tall for the bar level. We were pretty much the first ones there and my friend was reminded within five minutes of sitting that we only had the table for two hours so to order soon. Not a great start. The waiter we had on the bar was not friendly and came across condescending when explaining I was n’t ordering enough( we had n’t been told about the small plates before that). 14-25 per small plate and being expected to order about 5-6 between you felt a lot based on the service too. Our waiter would n’t leave us alone and we got urged to order about three times before we finally did. We probably would stayed longer( we only stayed just over an hour) and had more food if it was n’t for the rushed feeling. Nothing was labelled on the chalkboard as vegetarian or if there were allergies present. Even after speaking to the waiter, I was a little confused. The chef who made my meal was lovely, but he did put meat on it after the waiter had told me that one was vegetarian. | really excite go seem cute sat bar stool mad tall bar level pretty much first one friend remind within five minute sit table two hour order soon not great start waiter bar not friendly come across condescend explain n t order enough n t tell small plate per small plate expect order felt lot base service waiter would n t leave u alone get urged order three time finally probably would stay long stayed hour food n t rush feel nothing label chalkboard vegetarian allergy present even speak waiter little confused chef make meal lovely put meat waiter tell one vegetarian | 0 | 1
LCD backlights have an expected lifespan, typically measured in hours. It can be a pretty wide range of hours from 20,000 - 100,000 hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components, screen brightness & other settings, environment it was being used in, so on and so forth. Some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans (with lots of caveats).

How many hours per day did you use the monitor? What brightness level? Was the room it was in hot or humid? Did it get direct sunlight? Etc etc etc.  Multiply the amount of hours you used it by 4 years, take off a bunch for whatever conditions, and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor, then you can argue (per Australin consumer law) that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it isn't meeting the expected lifespan.

But if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor, you're going to have a much harder time arguing that point. | lcd backlights expect lifespan typically measured hour pretty wide range hour hour depend multiple thing quality component screen brightness setting environment use forth manufacturer advertise expect lifespan lot caveat many hour per day use monitor brightness level room hot humid get direct sunlight etc etc etc multiply amount hour use year take bunch whatever condition number get significantly expect lifespan monitor argue per australin consumer law despite warranty still valid return not meet expect lifespan rough estimate total hour use around expect monitor go much hard time argue point | 1 | 0

The place looks excellent from outside, the decor is quite cool and everything but staying there reveals the real place! Firstly, some ground floor rooms are abominable. Also some upper floor rooms have old window AC and old TV! Now coming to the service, the buffet breakfast is really small with about 4 items and although they claim that it starts at 7, you can not get anything before and at times even before 8! The bar is kinda not up to the standards of a family restaurant. It gives off a seedy vibe which makes it not a good place to be with one family. While the Indian food served in this place is quite delectable the Chinese food is a real horror! There's no swimming pool. Also if you want to hang out your wet clothes from a trip to the beach they do not offer a place for that. You have to go for their highly expensive laundry service instead. Also, it's located quite a bit away from Aberdeen Bazar | place look excellent outside decor quite cool everything stay reveals real place firstly ground floor room abominable also upper floor room old window ac old tv come service buffet breakfast really small item although claim start not get anything time even bar kind not standard family restaurant give seedy vibe make not good place one family indian food serve place quite delectable chinese food real horror no swimming pool also want hang wet clothes trip beach not offer place go highly expensive laundry service instead also locate quite bite away aberdeen bazar | 0 | 1

No its more about risk management, why accept a small % more to run the risk that an inspection might find something unforeseen and your sale falls through when u can accept a little less for an unconditional sale.

A lot of people of your age with hot blood will advise you to stand up for yourself and leave the house as soon as possible. Please don't do that. By leaving the house or fighting back, you will not solve anything. You are perhaps too young to understand a few things, and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful. Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.

I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 

We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 

The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.

The only answer is unconditional love and respect.

Unless someone is physically abusive, in this case, you must stand up for yourself and the sake of other family members. | lot people age hot blood advise stand leave house soon possible please not leave house fight back not solve anything perhaps young understand thing okay not say disrespectful everyone go life phase try give wisdom hopefully use advantage similar situation grow middle class family one day sudden angry father love respect lot never say got diagnose aggressive brain tumor fast forward month take last breath arm neither u say much love cared take thing people grant realize value no longer around way solve situation one party compromise know would think learn new way elder young one love first not work need talk love respect continue one day realize even not no regret later life answer unconditional love respect unless someone physically abusive case must stand sake family member | 1 | 0

I also just got one from Bayside and appealed it. Still waiting on a response. 

I parked in trailer parking at Black Rock alongside 15+ other cars. I only had just pulled in, paid for a ticket, got back to my car and the inspector printed the ticket right in front of me. $192.

I was polite. Took photos, had a chat to them. 5 minutes from paid parking ticket to the car, they’d best let me go. I’d be happy to proceed to court otherwise. I didn’t know cars couldn’t park there. 

If they let me go, then cool. If they don’t, you can go to court but I wager if it’s worth my time. Probably not.

If you change the account password on booking.com, they won’t be able to sign into booking.com  again, which will stop the influx of failed payment Noti emails into your inbox. 

There’s no need to close your email account, really. I’ve had my info in data breaches 6 times in 2013 and I’m still using the same email address, although I’m now using “hide my email” in iOS so it isn’t being put out online anymore. It makes up an random email address when signing up for things and diverts them into my one inbox. If something looks a little suspect, it’s easy to deactivate the fake address and that’s the end of that. Also handy to catch out companies that have sold someone else my info.

The card is old, so that’s sweet. Weird that they tried to use it though. They’d have seen the expiry date and they don’t work very well after the end of the month that it expires in.

Pretty trendy pizza place but was n’t amazed by it. The atmosphere was nice but very loud with fans going nonstop. The pizza itself was alright but not good enough to warrant a return trip here.

The service was slow but very friendly, I do n’t want to mark them down too much here because there were only two members of staff doing all the service for a full restaurant.

This cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around! Less than 6 per person, even when booking our tickets online. My husband and I went at the end of March. I have a disability, so arrived a little earlier to allow time to get from the nearby car park to the cinema, as there is no parking outside the building. The lift is quite hidden and easily missed. It was rather old looking, much like the rest of the cinema, and very, very slow going both up and down. Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small. Sadly, most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby, though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability I managed a 2hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting, which is good for me. Despite the few negative points, I will definitely come again, mainly due to how close it is to my home and the fact that it does n't cost us an arm and a leg!! | cinema one cheapest cinema around less per person even book ticket online husband go end march disability arrive little earlier allow time get nearby car park cinema no parking outside build lift quite hidden easily miss rather old look much like rest cinema slow go anyone n t like lift much probably not like one also rather small sadly cinema decor look old rather shabby though seat small cinema quite comfortable despite disability manage hr screen without much discomfort fidget good despite negative point definitely come mainly due close home fact n t cost u arm leg | 1 | 0

Ridiculously overpriced food-you can get better at KFC for less. Was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at Wingstop sounded very tasty on the board. I ordered the box of 8 boneless chicken, fries with the Wingstop flavoring and a drink. What was served up however, was mediocre, the chicken was just warm and did n't contain much sauce on them. In the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring-mine arrived with a dash of flavour. I do have to say the Brazilian and Mango Habanero sauces were good though. The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again. If I ever did venture in again, perhaps I'd try a burger. | ridiculously overprice food get good kfc less look forward try something different norm chicken marinade selection wingstop sound tasty board order box boneless chicken fry wingstop flavor drink serve however mediocre chicken warm n t contain much sauce advert pic chicken drench sauce flavour mine arrive dash flavour say brazilian mango habanero sauce good though fry wingstop season ok season contain clump sugar n t enjoy much near would n t ever venture perhaps would try burger | 0 | 1

Seeing no love for the Monash!

So here goes! 

1 the legitimate M1/A1 that is Australias highway! 

2 doesn’t dump you on to to a regular road at the city end 

3 goes more places! West gate/tulla freeways/ City through to lakes entrance! 

4 only so busy because it’s so useful! 

5 (a stretch here) my experience is that the connecting roads are worse on the eastern at peak times . Alex parade is a car park, hoddle st is hoddle st, chandler highway to kew jnc is a nightmare, chandler north used to be the biggest bottleneck in the state (now fixed)… Tran rd Doncaster road, bulleen rd all problematic! 

6 will be just as busy as the Monash when the north east link opens! 


PS in reality I do have many complaints about the Monash, mostly the people on it! | see no love monash go legitimate australia highway not dump regular road city end go place west gate tulla freeways city lake entrance busy useful stretch experience connect road bad eastern peak time alex parade car park hoddle st hoddle st chandler highway kew jnc nightmare chandler north use big bottleneck state fix tran rd doncaster road bulleen rd problematic busy monash north east link open ps reality many complaint monash mostly people | 0 | 1

Entering as a walk in, the venue was very accommodating and were able to find a table for two very quickly. We were provided with drinks also very quickly which was very good service. The service was the highlight of this visit. The low rating is due to the food. We ordered a seafood vongole and a seafood risotto with a side of truffle fries and tenderstem broccoli. The brocoli and the fries were lovely but we were both deeply disappointed with our main dishes. Both were bland, lacked seasoning, and neither tasted of seafood. We found ourselves prioritising the brocoli and fries which was noted by the attentive staff. How a plate of clams and pasta can taste of nothing was beyond my imagination for such a highly rated restaurant. | enter walk venue accommodate able find table two quickly provide drink also quickly good service service highlight visit low rating due food order seafood vongole seafood risotto side truffle fry tenderstem broccoli brocoli fry lovely deeply disappointed main dish bland lack season neither taste seafood find prioritise brocoli fry note attentive staff plate clam pasta taste nothing beyond imagination highly rat restaurant | 0 | 1

Prachi is a familiar name when it comes to heritage standalone movie theatres of Kolkata. Prachi began it's operations in the year 1948, the year after India gained Independence. Founder Jiten Basu launched his venture and his son Dipendranath took over soon after. However, his stewardship was short-lived, and Dipendranath passed away while his father was still alive. It was then left to Jiten Basu granddaughter Bidisha to take charge, and her battle for survival continued amidst the strong challenges posed by the multiplexes and mushrooming OTT platforms. While Prachi initially screened only Bengali films, it has evolved with the times to now accommodate Hindi and English cinema too. Basu has even upgraded the projection system to screen 3D films. | prachi familiar name come heritage standalone movie theatre kolkata prachi begin operation year year india gain independence founder jiten basu launch venture son dipendranath take soon however stewardship short live dipendranath pass away father still alive leave jiten basu granddaughter bidisha take charge battle survival continue amidst strong challenge pose multiplex mushroom ott platform prachi initially screen bengali film evolve time accommodate hindi english cinema basu even upgrade projection system screen film | 1 | 0

The kebabs starters served were not even warm. Though sigries were placed on the table but not so warm. Service was too slow. Every time we have to ask for starters. We requested kebabs but limited were served. The order for mocktails took too long to serve. We had to remind the server. The buffet spread was good with indian and Chinese only.

A lot of it would be out of government control such as world commodity price fluctuations, GFC, Covid, drought etc. It also simply measures economic management in GDP growth.

I dropped out of my science degree, so I'm personally a bad example LOL. But because I was part of a Science cohort, and now work at the uni I dropped out of, I happen to have a lot of Science uni friends. 

I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 

Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.

My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 

My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 

A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD). | drop science degree personally bad example lol part science cohort work uni drop happen lot science uni friend say no one make big buck not know anyone astrophysics though know handful phd student field relatively prestigious university undergraduate participate institutional research project prior phd anecdotal story friends science grad best friend double degree chemistry commerce always smart hardworking work sydney water salary k partner forensic science major skill lean towards chemistry tell first year date year old not go find job field impossible field science get unless want get mess join police get transfer science role since one university pathology lab pay pretty bad though k work night shift job not stressful not career ambitious handful friend work lab research assistant full time equivelent salary k not able get full time ongoing employment ok research master think phd | 1 | 0

The culinary experience left much to be desired as the dishes were overwhelmed with excessive oil and an overpowering saltiness, lacking in nuanced flavors. To salvage the meal, I resorted to enhancing it with a simple accompaniment of lemon and onion. Even with the addition of gravy, the dish failed to meet expectations. The ambiance would benefit from enhancements, with potential for more captivating interiors and heightened cleanliness. Staff training is imperative to reduce wait times and ensure a more seamless dining experience. | culinary experience leave much desire dish overwhelm excessive oil overpower saltiness lack nuanced flavor salvage meal resort enhance simple accompaniment lemon onion even addition gravy dish fail meet expectation ambiance would benefit enhancement potential captivating interior heighten cleanliness staff train imperative reduce wait time ensure seamless din experience | 1 | 0

I've heard this restaurant name a lot so I visited this restaurant during durga pujo. But they disappointed me by saying that only biriyani is available. Then i ordered 1 chicken biriyani, 1 mutton nd 1 extra chicken. Tbh the quantity of biriyani is so less nd the chicken piece & mutton piece are so bad. The extra chicken i ordered costs bloody 50 rs. The ambience is n't so good. Very bad experience. | heard restaurant name lot visit restaurant durga pujo disappoint say biriyani available order chicken biriyani mutton nd extra chicken honest quantity biriyani less nd chicken piece mutton piece bad extra chicken order cost bloody rs ambience n t good bad experience | 0 | 1

Arriving at the Ivy Asia on a wet Manchester evening was a bit bemused at the refusal by staff to accept the collapsible umbrella in case they lost it! Well, do n't lose it then. So we dine with a wet umbrella. The decor is stunning, the food really good, but the service, sadly lacking. Did n't appreciate our server breaking off to talk to another member of staff whilst we were ordering. Decided to go for small plates, all of which arrived in good time and were delicious. No complaints whatsoever there. But after that, no one was interested in us. Seemed that most, not all, of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners. Friends ? Local celebrity ? The restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service. Decided against a dessert and figured it would be too much trouble to get a coffee so we paid and left. Wo n't go back. Shame really because the food and the restaurant itself are great. Back to the Tattu next time methinks! | arrive ivy asia wet manchester even bit bemused refusal staff accept collapsible umbrella case lose well n t lose dine wet umbrella decor stun food really good service sadly lack n t appreciate server break talk another member staff whilst order decide go small plate arrive good time delicious no complaint whatsoever no one interest u seem not server prefer spending lengthy period flirt one particular trio diner friends local celebrity restaurant almost full anyone not play part bound impact quality service decide dessert figure would much trouble get coffee pay leave wo n t go back shame really food restaurant great back tattu next time methinks | 0 | 1
