Holy shit these are fucking adorable!

You do need better photos though. Invest in a lightbox (or make one, if you're handy with DIY stuff) There are also apps with built-in AI that you can use to create a cool looking backdrop for these. Stuff like this will really help you go a long way.

We watched a movie on Small 3: it's tiny, similar size as a home cinema projector. It's still nice but not what we expected for this price. The only food available is disgusting and expensive( cold hot dogs and tasteless nachos).

Sydney and Melbourne although it’s pretty ridiculous either way. Literally oranges vs apple type argument. It’s natural though as they’re two of the biggest cities in the country with a similar population. 

NSW vs QLD State of Origin is probably the closest answer and most reasonable. Most people I know that don’t bother watching regular NRL games almost always tune into State of Origin anyways. (Speaking as someone from Sydney) there’s a wholly agreed upon sentiment to hate the other state out of loyalty of their own.  The rivalry isn’t as heated as something you’d find in a European football league but it’s close as you’ll get in Australia. | sydney melbourne although pretty ridiculous either way literally oranges v apple type argument natural though two big city country similar population nsw v qld state origin probably close answer reasonable people know not bother watch regular nrl game almost always tune state origin anyways speak someone sydney wholly agree upon sentiment hate state loyalty rivalry not heat something would find european football league close get australia | 1 | 0
Charming. Expensive, yes. But you go knowing that. I had the steak tartare for starter. Small but yum. He had the butternut tortellini. Also small but yum. Main, I had the eye fillet steak which was great( sorry hopeless photo to show steak). He had the fish risotto. It is n’t a ‘ risotto ’. It maybe two tablespoons off risotto. He felt underfed and disappointed so if you want bang for your buck, go the eye fillet. We do feel more needs to be added to the fish dish in order to be had again. Ordered the dish of greens.

I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene! I visited with my wife the second time, we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries, which came to. We wo n't be back. | love burger try five guy twice disappoint first visit award star want give second try find offer unfortunately consistent drop rating star quality ingredient bite good standard fast food offering like mcdonalds burger king however cost time price mcdonalds consistent bit bland burger king prone inconsistency delivery service grubby restaurant tasty burger would tolerable five guy burger immensely bland lack season beefy flavour no sear outside bacon crispy appear achieve deep frying suitably uniform colour give bacon scorch flavour also unsmoked lost opportunity make tasty portion fry generous would rather pay half price half quantity generosity probably cynical technique sell would want inflate price fry also bite seasoned premium price give impression faultless high quality delicious offering yet fall significantly short n t bad well significantly less first visit spend burger fry milkshake frankly obscene visit wife second time bacon cheeseburger share small fry come wo n t back | 0 | 1

Any language is learned by communicating in that language like you would with a toddler who knows no other language. So yes, it's frustrating when you communicate in English and they don't understand, so you give up and switch to your local language. DON'T. Or they'll never learn. Use signs etc anything but another language to make them understand what you're saying. Isn't that how you taught them your native language?

Start with simple sentences and words and then ramp up. Talk to your partner in English in front of your kids and they'll passively pick up. It's not going to happen in a month so have patience. | language learn communicating language like would toddler know no language yes frustrating communicate english not understand give switch local language not never learn use sign etc anything another language make understand say not taught native language start simple sentence word ramp talk partner english front kid passively pick not go happen month patience | 1 | 0
I thoroughly asked the waiter which meals are vegan-got a sandwich and veggie burger with mayonaise. They told me first it's only plant based, no eggs. The manager even showed me the package with the ingredients. It contained milk solids. I had some painful hours afterwards digesting it. Things like that must never happen in a restaurant. The staff should know what they serve-but I assume they mainly serve readymade factory food. The lemon tea taste like instant tea, the fruit shakes are only fruit flavored, no real fruit( according to waiter). If you want to know what you eat, go elsewhere.

The drive itself is interesting if you like long stretches of driving. 

However, I’m not sure it’d be enjoyable or interesting at a slower pace. 

Also there are few to zero interesting towns between Ceduna and Norseman, so that will be a long slog. 

You will also have trucks, road trains and caravaners overtaking you probably too close. Those bigger vehicles push a lot of air when they pass, and you feel it in vehicles like a dual cab, I’d hate to be on something like a postie bike. | drive interest like long stretch drive however not sure would enjoyable interest slow pace also zero interesting town ceduna norseman long slog also truck road train caravaners overtake probably close big vehicle push lot air pas feel vehicle like dual cab would hate something like postie bike | 1 | 0

Demonize is a strong word. And not Mughals, just that Aurangzeb. Dara Shikoh, his brother, would have united India with his already refined interest in all religions. Aurangzeb was a deeply religious/devout Muslim ruler. And while you are not wrong about destruction of temples as a power move, you cannot blame the people for disliking him. As far as the other rulers are concerned, they hold no special place in most people's mind, unlike Aurangzeb who has been portrayed as the upholder of law and peace. | demonize strong word not mughals aurangzeb dara shikoh brother would unite india already refine interest religion aurangzeb deeply religious devout muslim ruler not wrong destruction temple power move not blame people dislike far ruler concerned hold no special place people mind unlike aurangzeb portray upholder law peace | 1 | 0

LCD backlights have an expected lifespan, typically measured in hours. It can be a pretty wide range of hours from 20,000 - 100,000 hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components, screen brightness & other settings, environment it was being used in, so on and so forth. Some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans (with lots of caveats).

How many hours per day did you use the monitor? What brightness level? Was the room it was in hot or humid? Did it get direct sunlight? Etc etc etc.  Multiply the amount of hours you used it by 4 years, take off a bunch for whatever conditions, and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor, then you can argue (per Australin consumer law) that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it isn't meeting the expected lifespan.

But if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor, you're going to have a much harder time arguing that point. | lcd backlights expect lifespan typically measured hour pretty wide range hour hour depend multiple thing quality component screen brightness setting environment use forth manufacturer advertise expect lifespan lot caveat many hour per day use monitor brightness level room hot humid get direct sunlight etc etc etc multiply amount hour use year take bunch whatever condition number get significantly expect lifespan monitor argue per australin consumer law despite warranty still valid return not meet expect lifespan rough estimate total hour use around expect monitor go much hard time argue point | 1 | 0

Serving staff were friendly and drinks were served fast. Unfortunately we waited 45 minutes for mains to be served. Food visually looked great, however the tomato based pastas were quite rich and heavy with the lasagna being layered with way too much cheese. Just lacked that traditional tomato freshness.

There’s still lots of money out there being spent and it’s pushing up inflation. I work in sales, we distribute composite decking, cladding and screening through trade hardware stores. 

Generally speaking cladding goes on new builds while decking is mostly for the renovations/add on market. Usually the colder months are slow, with cladding holding sales together, while summers the decking really takes off (people are short sighted, they only want to put in decks when it gets warm and realise they don’t have one, or their existing one is falling apart). 

We had a bit of a slow start this year, but this month we are getting ‘summer’ level of sales, both in decking and cladding, which is something that none of us really expected. Cladding would make sense because builds happen year round, but people are spending big on renovations as well, which isn’t what you’d expect during a cost of living crisis. 

As much as I’d love to say this is because I’m an amazing sales rep, every other state is pushing similar numbers, with sales at 120% of budget coming into the end of financial year. I’ve got friends that work for our competitors and they are also seeing the same results. There may be a cost of living crisis somewhere, but it sure as shit isn’t everywhere, and we expect even more money pumped into the economy come early August as that’s bonus/commission season for anyone in sales and corporate, as well as tax return season. | still lots money spend push inflation work sale distribute composite deck cladding screen trade hardware store generally speak cladding go new build deck mostly renovation add market usually colder month slow cladding hold sale together summer deck really take people short sight want put deck get warm realise not one exist one fall apart bit slow start year month get summer level sale deck cladding something none u really expect cladding would make sense build happen year round people spend big renovation well not would expect cost live crisis much would love say amazing sale rep every state push similar number sale budget come end financial year get friend work competitor also see result may cost living crisis somewhere sure shit not everywhere expect even money pump economy come early august bonus commission season anyone sale corporate well tax return season | 1 | 0

This cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around! Less than 6 per person, even when booking our tickets online. My husband and I went at the end of March. I have a disability, so arrived a little earlier to allow time to get from the nearby car park to the cinema, as there is no parking outside the building. The lift is quite hidden and easily missed. It was rather old looking, much like the rest of the cinema, and very, very slow going both up and down. Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small. Sadly, most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby, though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability I managed a 2hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting, which is good for me. Despite the few negative points, I will definitely come again, mainly due to how close it is to my home and the fact that it does n't cost us an arm and a leg!! | cinema one cheapest cinema around less per person even book ticket online husband go end march disability arrive little earlier allow time get nearby car park cinema no parking outside build lift quite hidden easily miss rather old look much like rest cinema slow go anyone n t like lift much probably not like one also rather small sadly cinema decor look old rather shabby though seat small cinema quite comfortable despite disability manage hr screen without much discomfort fidget good despite negative point definitely come mainly due close home fact n t cost u arm leg | 1 | 0

Great location for people travelling via Hammersmith Station, and for those going to a concert at either Shepherd Bush Empire or Eventim Apollo. The room was much smaller than expected, especially in comparison to rooms in other Premier Inns. The curtain in the room also did n’t fully shut out all of the light which was inconvenient now that the sun is rising very early.

Gone with family for dinner. Tried chicken briyani which taste is okay like home briyani and only one slight big chicken piece.( Seeraga samba briyani) Tried moru moru chicken which taste is good. But too crispy actually the chicken is not soft. Fried rice is too blunt with no flavour and only with vegetables. Chicken rice is somewhat okay but with less flavours.

Ridiculously overpriced food-you can get better at KFC for less. Was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at Wingstop sounded very tasty on the board. I ordered the box of 8 boneless chicken, fries with the Wingstop flavoring and a drink. What was served up however, was mediocre, the chicken was just warm and did n't contain much sauce on them. In the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring-mine arrived with a dash of flavour. I do have to say the Brazilian and Mango Habanero sauces were good though. The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again. If I ever did venture in again, perhaps I'd try a burger. | ridiculously overprice food get good kfc less look forward try something different norm chicken marinade selection wingstop sound tasty board order box boneless chicken fry wingstop flavor drink serve however mediocre chicken warm n t contain much sauce advert pic chicken drench sauce flavour mine arrive dash flavour say brazilian mango habanero sauce good though fry wingstop season ok season contain clump sugar n t enjoy much near would n t ever venture perhaps would try burger | 0 | 1

Arriving at the Ivy Asia on a wet Manchester evening was a bit bemused at the refusal by staff to accept the collapsible umbrella in case they lost it! Well, do n't lose it then. So we dine with a wet umbrella. The decor is stunning, the food really good, but the service, sadly lacking. Did n't appreciate our server breaking off to talk to another member of staff whilst we were ordering. Decided to go for small plates, all of which arrived in good time and were delicious. No complaints whatsoever there. But after that, no one was interested in us. Seemed that most, not all, of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners. Friends ? Local celebrity ? The restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service. Decided against a dessert and figured it would be too much trouble to get a coffee so we paid and left. Wo n't go back. Shame really because the food and the restaurant itself are great.

I was polite. Took photos, had a chat to them. 5 minutes from paid parking ticket to the car, they’d best let me go. I’d be happy to proceed to court otherwise. I didn’t know cars couldn’t park there. 

If they let me go, then cool. If they don’t, you can go to court but I wager if it’s worth my time. Probably not.

The staff recommended their special tandoori fish fry, which we found delightful. Following that, we tried their chicken malai kebab, which was also excellent. However, when we ordered the chicken biryani, we found the chicken a bit chewy, and the potatoes were undercooked. Nonetheless, we ended our meal on a high note with their refreshing lime soda, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

A lot of people of your age with hot blood will advise you to stand up for yourself and leave the house as soon as possible. Please don't do that. By leaving the house or fighting back, you will not solve anything. You are perhaps too young to understand a few things, and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful. Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.

I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 

We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 

The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.

The only answer is unconditional love and respect.

Unless someone is physically abusive, in this case, you must stand up for yourself and the sake of other family members. | lot people age hot blood advise stand leave house soon possible please not leave house fight back not solve anything perhaps young understand thing okay not say disrespectful everyone go life phase try give wisdom hopefully use advantage similar situation grow middle class family one day sudden angry father love respect lot never say got diagnose aggressive brain tumor fast forward month take last breath arm neither u say much love cared take thing people grant realize value no longer around way solve situation one party compromise know would think learn new way elder young one love first not work need talk love respect continue one day realize even not no regret later life answer unconditional love respect unless someone physically abusive case must stand sake family member | 1 | 0

I dropped out of my science degree, so I'm personally a bad example LOL. But because I was part of a Science cohort, and now work at the uni I dropped out of, I happen to have a lot of Science uni friends. 

I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 

Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.

My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 

My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 

A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD). | drop science degree personally bad example lol part science cohort work uni drop happen lot science uni friend say no one make big buck not know anyone astrophysics though know handful phd student field relatively prestigious university undergraduate participate institutional research project prior phd anecdotal story friends science grad best friend double degree chemistry commerce always smart hardworking work sydney water salary k partner forensic science major skill lean towards chemistry tell first year date year old not go find job field impossible field science get unless want get mess join police get transfer science role since one university pathology lab pay pretty bad though k work night shift job not stressful not career ambitious handful friend work lab research assistant full time equivelent salary k not able get full time ongoing employment ok research master think phd | 1 | 0

The place looks excellent from outside, the decor is quite cool and everything but staying there reveals the real place! Firstly, some ground floor rooms are abominable. Also some upper floor rooms have old window AC and old TV! Now coming to the service, the buffet breakfast is really small with about 4 items and although they claim that it starts at 7, you can not get anything before and at times even before 8! The bar is kinda not up to the standards of a family restaurant. It gives off a seedy vibe which makes it not a good place to be with one family. While the Indian food served in this place is quite delectable the Chinese food is a real horror! There's no swimming pool. Also if you want to hang out your wet clothes from a trip to the beach they do not offer a place for that. You have to go for their highly expensive laundry service instead. Also, it's located quite a bit away from Aberdeen Bazar | place look excellent outside decor quite cool everything stay reveals real place firstly ground floor room abominable also upper floor room old window ac old tv come service buffet breakfast really small item although claim start not get anything time even bar kind not standard family restaurant give seedy vibe make not good place one family indian food serve place quite delectable chinese food real horror no swimming pool also want hang wet clothes trip beach not offer place go highly expensive laundry service instead also locate quite bite away aberdeen bazar | 0 | 1

A lot of it would be out of government control such as world commodity price fluctuations, GFC, Covid, drought etc. It also simply measures economic management in GDP growth. You could probably also get big economic GDP growth if you borrowed a lot of money and just spend spend spend, or sold a lot of assets like Howard and Keating for money to spend.

You could argue that ideally, we have to top out our population at some time, so constant GDP growth isn't necessary if our population stays the same and we stop putting more stress on the environment with never ending addiction to growth. Standard of living is not necessarily tied to GDP growth, especially if measured on a per capita basis. | lot would government control world commodity price fluctuation gfc covid drought etc also simply measure economic management gdp growth could probably also get big economic gdp growth borrow lot money spend spend spend sell lot asset like howard keating money spend could argue ideally top population time constant gdp growth not necessary population stay stop put stress environment never end addiction growth standard live not necessarily tie gdp growth especially measure per caput basis | 1 | 0

I reserved a table and made a special note when booking that it was for a birthday. They also advertise that you get a great seat and free chocolate etc. None of this was realized at all. We had the table right at the entrance, which was not a great place at all and there was no other attention to the birthday. Why do you promote this and yet 0 is implemented ? When the food arrived, we were disappointed once again. My partner ordered the steak medium rare and got a steak well done... in a steak restaurant you expect that the cooking levels should n't be a problem and that they know their way around. He had to give the meat back and I had to eat it once because otherwise it got cold. Great to celebrate a birthday in the restaurant and I ca n't even eat with my partner at the same time. Then his food arrived( when I had almost finished eating) and the meat was only cooked medium. absolute disappointment Dessert: when we got the dessert menu we had to wait over 20 minutes to be able to order.

If you change the account password on booking.com, they won’t be able to sign into booking.com  again, which will stop the influx of failed payment Noti emails into your inbox. 

There’s no need to close your email account, really. I’ve had my info in data breaches 6 times in 2013 and I’m still using the same email address, although I’m now using “hide my email” in iOS so it isn’t being put out online anymore. It makes up an random email address when signing up for things and diverts them into my one inbox. If something looks a little suspect, it’s easy to deactivate the fake address and that’s the end of that. Also handy to catch out companies that have sold someone else my info.

The card is old, so that’s sweet. Weird that they tried to use it though. They’d have seen the expiry date and they don’t work very well after the end of the month that it expires in.

I used to belong to the Stratford Picture House when it was a clean, nice place and the benefits were good. I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed( so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond.

I don't know much about why the price is high. One reasone is that Marine variants tend to be costlier than normal jets

And I am a fan of Russian jets. I just love the sukhoi's.

But there are several reasons to not buy Russian jets. 

1. Russia is also friends with China, and china also own a few variants of sukhoi's, even the variants of su-30(su-30mki is the backbone of Indian Air force).
Infact Chinese jets are half stolen US reverse engineered tech and the rest is russian. 
2. Rafale's are in a league of their own, a few years ago french forces, claimed to have won a dogfight with f-22 raptor in a friendly exercise.
3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes/ maintainance times than western jets and their engines.
4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale)
5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense
6. Rafal's are launched by catapult whereas Russian aircrafts by ski jump. (Catapult is considered to be superior).
7. Also the diversification factor. | not know much price high one reasone marine variant tend costly normal jet fan russian jet love sukhoi several reason not buy russian jet russia also friends china china also variants sukhoi even variant su su mki backbone indian air force infact chinese jet half steal u reverse engineer tech rest russian rafale league year ago french force claim dogfight f raptor friendly exercise russian jet engine not good western counterpart although faster lot bulky big substantially downtimes maintainance time western jet engines russian engine average last hrs american one last k hour not sure rafale rafal lot reliable good avionics etc make sense rafal launch catapult whereas russian aircraft ski jump catapult consider superior also diversification factor | 1 | 0

Best cafe in kottayam situated opposite to Ceaser Palace. Got ample car parking. Opens upto 12 am. Staffs are super friendly. I am a reqular customer since their initial time. Found best in town at that time. But today sad to say that the items are not consistent in taste wise. Best dishes # Steak with mashed potato and sauted veggies # tikka with afgani rice # crispy fried burger # crumb fried sausages # penne pasta with meat balls # loaded Fries # Club sandwich # Fried samoosa # hot chocolate( advised not to add extra sugar as it is already sweeetened) # Lemon ice tea # juices # waffles # Ceaser salad # Brownie # coffee # shakes # blood Mary mojitos Juicy Lucy burger is not that ones which we get in abroad. Not recommended. Outdoor seating is there. Advised to sit outside if you are planning for a date or a meeting beacuse the music that they are playing is at high volume and can cause irritation. They got a massive 75 inch television for live matches. Got barista machine. Clean and neat washroom is there.

Hey Legends. Thanks for the advice and the pointers. The landlords and the real estate agent came over yesterday to have a look and yes, it is a mess up there, full of rat and possum shit and piss. The joy.

They are getting a pest man and a possum man to clean up and treat the area over the next week. Thankful for such a quick response from them. They seem to be taking it seriously and it's not an uncommon thing i.e they have dealt with it before.

They are also taking liberties to board up / put mesh on the roof where the possums and the rodents might be getting in. | hey legends thanks advice pointer landlord real estate agent come yesterday look yes mess full rat possum shit piss joy get pest man possum man clean treat area next week thankful quick response seem take seriously not uncommon thing e dealt also take liberty board put mesh roof possum rodent might get | 1 | 0

I’m in Tassie. If you got an auto license you can’t drive a manual until you either pass the P’s test in a manual OR it’s been a certain amount of time since you’ve had your open license and you can get the auto condition removed (this is what I did, I got the condition removed in my early 20’s). 

Not sure about other states - the process will vary.  | tassie get auto license not drive manual either pass p test manual certain amount time since open license get auto condition remove got condition remove early not sure state process vary | 1 | 0

Tram way back in the 90s, hit a car.

After school and packed.

I was holding on, my friend was not.

I saw him yeet, down the aisle as if he were falling off a cliff, taking the whole aisle with him.

He maintained eye contact the whole way, wide eyed with an outstretched hand.

One of those slow motion moments.

A++ would experience again. | tram way back hit car school pack hold friend not saw yeet aisle fall cliff take whole aisle maintain eye contact whole way wide eye outstretched hand one slow motion moment would experience | 1 | 0
Combo units have two good points.  They take up less room, and they are set and forget.  You can chuck a load of washing into it in the morning, and when you get home from work, it will be clean and dry.

&#x200B;

They take a LOT longer though, and there's no lint filter, so you either have to run the tub clean cycle or wipe the lint out somehow. | combo unit two good point take less room set forget chuck load wash morning get home work clean dry x b take lot long though no lint filter either run tub clean cycle wipe lint somehow | 1 | 0
Tough days I know for the Tyneside cinema. But this constant raising prices.... it's now 5 quid for soup of the day. That's the cheapest lunch on offer here now. 14 quid for a vegan burger! Providing a good value lunch will bring punters in, not fleecing the folk that still continue to come here. At some point even we will call it a day. The staff continue to smile and do their best.

This famous Bakery is located at Bikaner House and managed by the famous Chor Bizarre. They both outdoor and indoor seating options. There indoor cafe have some water leakage marks on mirror and walls, rest interiors are good. Staff is polite and prompt. We ordered Hot chocolate Veg Spinach lasagne Veg mushroom Sandwich Veg PecalNut Brownie Veg Green house pizza. Their hot chocolate was just average. Lasagne was good. Mushroom Sandwich and pizza were really good. Their brownie was the best Overall loved the experience. Price wise it is a 4 star restaurant. Do note if you visit at their closing time like us you have to place all the orders before and they will ask you to clear the bill while eating since they need to close their accounts( that's what happened with us). It was a bit irritating but we understood their issues. | famous bakery locate bikaner house manage famous chor bizarre outdoor indoor seating option indoor cafe water leakage mark mirror wall rest interior good staff polite prompt order hot chocolate veg spinach lasagne veg mushroom sandwich veg pecalnut brownie veg green house pizza hot chocolate average lasagne good mushroom sandwich pizza really good brownie best overall love experience price wise star restaurant note visit closing time like u place order ask clear bill eat since need close account happen u bite irritating understood issue | 0 | 1

Never had fried eggs before! Delicious. The hardest part about this venue is trying to find where to enter. Both doors say( use other main entrance) ….. an arrow on the side door near the “ main entry ” might be helpful to point people through the main door with no signage( I almost walked away). Glad I persisted as it was a memorable breakfast and good coffee. I did sit in restaurant with an empty water glass for close to an hour and the venue was n’t busy. When I asked where to pay the waiter said “ do it on the way out ” in a short sharp tone even though he was next to a cashier. Diminished what was a nice breakfast. | never fry egg delicious hard part venue try find enter door say use main entrance arrow side door near main entry might helpful point people main door no signage almost walk away glad persist memorable breakfast good coffee sit restaurant empty water glass close hour venue n t busy ask pay waiter say way short sharp tone even though next cashier diminish nice breakfast | 0 | 1
Two nights in a “ deluxe ” junior suite. Really lovely and helpful staff throughout. Good cocktails in the bar. Suite furnishings a little tired. Everything a little bit scuffed, worn, chipped, scraped. One of the espresso cups was dirty inside. I did n’t raise this any of with the hotel-not like they can quickly refurbish or would run off and check every cup in every other room And it not like any of it ruined my stay. Just a bit … bleh. Air conditioning absolutely useless but was able to open windows, at least. Was fairly quiet even with the windows open. Room service very prompt. Very handy for Hyde Park and getting into the city center.

At some point during the evening the staff picked up that we were there for our anniversary and we received complimentary champagne and a plate of chocolates with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate.

The food was very delicious. There were a lot of people at lunch time, so the waiting time was 20 minutes. They did n't serve us water on the table which we found very irresponsible. Also the cleaning person was just brushing down waste directly to the floor from the table right in front of us. A little more cleanliness can be practiced. | food delicious lot people lunch time wait time minute n t serve u water table find irresponsible also clean person brush waste directly floor table right front u little cleanliness practice | 0 | 1
