A great bar  with great food in the hub  Milton Keynes  Brewdog has a large selection of beers the staple Brewdog beers  and some exciting guest beers and ciders to accompany them  There are also some more   exotic  expensive    cans in the fridges next to the bar  which are always interesting to try  I usually grab a few to share  The food is great the Buffalo Chicken Burger is a big favourite and the service is usually brilliant  This time  however  one main from our order was completely forgotten and then when reminded     minutes after the other   dishes had come out   the wrong burger was delivered and so everyone else had finished and needed to leave before I got my food  At the point of ordering there was also a few things not available  but with no signage   notes to let people know  The table gives you a QR code to order food   drink from  however after selecting everything and attempting to check out  it flags an error  This happened for all   of us  In spite of all of this  it still a good place to go  and the above is not the usual standard of service,1,great bar great food hub milton keyn brewdog larg select beer stapl brewdog beer excit guest beer cider accompani also exot expens can fridg next bar alway interest tri usual grab share food great buffalo chicken burger big favourit servic usual brilliant time howev one main order complet forgotten remind minut dish come wrong burger deliv everyon els finish need leav got food point order also thing not avail no signag note let peopl know tabl give qr code order food drink howev select everyth attempt check flag error happen us spite still good place go not usual standard servic

I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice  I was disappointed After my first visit  but awarded them   stars  I wanted to give them a second try  but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to   stars  The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings  like McDonalds or Burger King  However  the cost is   to   times the price of McDonalds  consistent  but a bit bland  or Burger King  prone to inconsistency in delivery   service  and grubby restaurants  but tasty burgers   This would be tolerable  but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland  They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour they have no sear on the outside  The bacon is crispy  but this appears to be achieved by deep frying  it has a suitably uniform colour  which gives the bacon a scorched flavour  It is also unsmoked a lost opportunity to make it tastier  The portions of fries are generous  but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity  the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you d want to inflate prices   The fries are also a bit over seasoned  The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless  high quality and above all delicious offering  yet it falls significantly short of this  It is n t bad  but better can be had for significantly less  For my first visit I spent for a burger  fries and a milkshake  which is frankly obscene  I visited with my wife the second time  we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries  which came to  We wo n t be back,0,love burger tri five guy twice disappoint first visit award star want give second tri found offer unfortun consist drop rate star qualiti ingredi bit better standard fast food offer like mcdonald burger king howev cost time price mcdonald consist bit bland burger king prone inconsist deliveri servic grubbi restaur tasti burger would toler five guy burger immens bland lack season beefi flavour no sear outsid bacon crispi appear achiev deep fri suitabl uniform colour give bacon scorch flavour also unsmok lost opportun make tastier portion fri gener would rather pay half price half quantiti generos probabl cynic techniqu sell want inflat price fri also bit season premium price give impress faultless high qualiti delici offer yet fall significantli short n t bad better significantli less first visit spent burger fri milkshak frankli obscen visit wife second time bacon cheeseburg share small fri came wo n t back

I made my first ever clubbing visit here as a fresh    year old a week ago and they really put the bar high  It seems people have had bad experiences with the door staff  but I disagree with what has been said about them  Admittedly I did show up pretty much as soon as they opened  so crowds were n t an issue  maybe that is the difference for others  I was thoroughly searched  which I am happy with  and even had a little chat with the door staff  telling them it was my first time visiting and he even gave a bit of a   pep   talk it was lovely  I made the mistake of not brining my student ID  so I payed    pounds for entry  not    but oh well  still the price I was expecting anyways  I had a couple of drinks across the evening  They tasted good  but I m convinced the vodka was watered down  as my drinks tasted a bit too bearable haha  Mixed feelings about the bar staff  some seemed quite fed up  but others seemed friendly  It was nice to see a range of different people from different backgrounds working in there  A good presence of security and welfare staff throughout the venue made it feel very safe  and the atmosphere was brilliant once it started to get busy  Everybody seemed to be having a really good time  When you leave  the cloakroom is a bit chaotic  but if you wait patiently you get through it eventually  For me  I had a brilliant night and it seems like others did too,1,made first ever club visit fresh year old week ago realli put bar high seem peopl bad experi door staff disagre said admittedli show pretti much soon open crowd n t issu mayb differ other thoroughli search happi even littl chat door staff tell first time visit even gave bit pep talk love made mistak not brine student id pay pound entri not oh well still price expect anyway coupl drink across even tast good convinc vodka water drink tast bit bearabl haha mix feel bar staff seem quit fed other seem friendli nice see rang differ peopl differ background work good presenc secur welfar staff throughout venu made feel safe atmospher brilliant start get busi everybodi seem realli good time leav cloakroom bit chaotic wait patient get eventu brilliant night seem like other

I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread  featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri salted chips and chili cheese bites  The Boss burger was a culinary delight  boasting succulent  perfectly cooked medium rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips  imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite  Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche  Amigos  choice did n t detract from the overall gastronomic experience  The peri peri salted chips were executed flawlessly  retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess  Moving on to the chili cheese bites  despite a slightly elevated saltiness  they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese  offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors  However  the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake  This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture  elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter  chocolate  and premium quality ice cream  Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression  In conclusion  my takeaway experience from Amigos  a halal establishment  was exceptional  Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates  I enthusiastically recommend Amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence,1,order takeout amigo savor exquisit spread featur renown boss burger alongsid peri salt chip chili chees bite boss burger culinari delight boast succul perfectli cook medium rare meat complement harmoni blend fri egg turkey strip impart delight smoki essenc everi bite though usual prefer seed bun sweeter brioch amigo choic n t detract overal gastronom experi peri peri salt chip execut flawlessli retain crispi infus flavor season avoid hint soggi move chili chees bite despit slightli elev salti outshon counterpart found elsewher delight gooey melt chees offer satisfi contrast textur flavor howev highlight culinari journey undoubtedli rees piec milkshak decad treat boast creami textur elev perfect fusion peanut butter chocol premium qualiti ice cream sip offer symphoni flavor tantal tast bud left last impress conclus takeaway experi amigo halal establish except everi element meticul craft delight even discern palat enthusiast recommend amigo gourmet burger enthusiast seek unforgett indulg

We went to see the Divine Beauty experience at the Cathedral tonight and had a very pleasant experience  There was a technical problem that delayed our entrance  resulting in a    minute wait but it seemed to go quickly  I could have done without the drop in temperature though  The  show  comprises of projected Christian images onto the walls and ceiling  with a specially composed soundtrack  I actually enjoyed the music as much  or possibly more than the images  It lasted around    mins and the room was not over crowded so all had a good view  The imagery felt a bit random despite the theme  and some of it was abstract  I think it would have been more powerful if it had told a story  Strangely I thought the setting was a distraction but that s probably just me  The show was enjoyable and very competitively pricef but I am not sure if it s something that you would see more than once,1,went see divin beauti experi cathedr tonight pleasant experi technic problem delay entranc result minut wait seem go quickli could done without drop temperatur though show compris project christian imag onto wall ceil special compos soundtrack actual enjoy music much possibl imag last around min room not crowd good view imageri felt bit random despit theme abstract think would power told stori strang thought set distract probabl show enjoy competit pricef not sure someth would see

I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area  I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure  To start there is n t really anywhere that close that s reliably available for disabled people  Some street parking is n t far away but it s a gamble if you re going for that route and tight on time for your movie  The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured  The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem  I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n t know if you can make it down to that area without assistance  The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay  One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n t try myself to see if you can use them without aid  The disabled toilet was disgusting  it did n t look like it had been cleaned all weekend  This was at   pm Sunday  and was quite small so not much room to maneuver  If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome  Then I made my way to screen   which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan  A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal  Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side  The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen  Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door  The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean  Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially  It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again,0,visit odeon new street first possibl last time depend film avail area imagin experi complet differ abl bodi perspect wheelchair user challeng sure start n t realli anywher close reliabl avail disabl peopl street park n t far away gambl go rout tight time movi cinema outsid easili mistaken coffe shop scaffold place current odeon sign obscur entranc fine two set stair screen film show pose small problem say small without much chanc see lift provid could use independ n t know make area without assist biggest posit came staff help oper lift occas without fuss delay one drawback fit one chair user time said could n t tri see use without aid disabl toilet disgust n t look like clean weekend pm sunday quit small not much room maneuv somebodi need carer insid imagin would troublesom made way screen websit look magnific seat plan rare reserv area back middl park ideal unlik usual option front row one side issu came open door slope lead screen nearli end chair sever time feet slip chair due lean forward open tri get door qualiti screen fine everyth outsid toilet clean person howev would not recommend cinema anyon els mobil issu especi would case need must visit

I had this place on my list for a while now  I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant  with a great ambient atmosphere  We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around  It did n t take long and the restaurant was   buzzing    it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign  The menu is very good with extensive options  including a tapas option  The drinks Menu is excellent  including non alcoholic drinks and Mocktails  We tried the scallops which we never tried before  definitely a hit  This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a   min wait   At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh   My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb  I never tried a lamb dish like this  a very different way of serving Lamb  a dish I enjoyed  but sadly would n t order again  The gravy was far too thin   watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce  The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well  A Beautiful combination  There are many attractive options on the menu  so even if you picky there is something for everyone  The dessert Menu has some great options too  Being a diabetic I did n t want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding  Sadly  right next to our table one of the customers passed out  The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful  They did n t make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual  The downside was staff put on the air con to provide the customer with some cool air  which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected   Go Cold  All in all  a great experience  I ca n t fault it  Beautiful Menu  great atmosphere  very good staff and definitely worth it,1,place list took opportun book surpris meal wife stun restaur great ambient atmospher got nice warm welcom servic offer pretti quickli oppos wait around n t take long restaur buzz fill pretti quick alway good sign menu good extens option includ tapa option drink menu excel includ non alcohol drink mocktail tri scallop never tri definit hit whilst wait main meal told would min wait least knew get cook fresh wife steak lamb never tri lamb dish like differ way serv lamb dish enjoy sadli would n t order gravi far thin wateri chef evid like use signatur pea sauc chip peppercorn sauc along steak compliment well beauti combin mani attract option menu even picki someth everyon dessert menu great option diabet n t want risk definit would white chocol pud sadli right next tabl one custom pass restaur staff accommod help n t make fuss assist get help young individu downsid staff put air con provid custom cool air meant rest restaur food would affect go cold great experi ca n t fault beauti menu great atmospher good staff definit worth

Update      I went to see Matilda at   pm on the  st of December the film was good but felt let down by the quality of the sound was really flat with minimal bass especially on a musical film  I paid the extra for the premier seats whilst being a different colour and a slightly higher back they really ai n t comfortable and I was starting to ache so had to keep moving about in my seat to get through the film whilst the seats look good the comfort was n t considered when they were made especially for sitting in for around   hours  The picture quality was really good with good brightness level  I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film  I really would like to see different straws available as the straws currently just go soggy and collapse around    minutes into the film I had   and had failed before I finished my large drink I ended up using a spare straw when I got back to my car I had from showcase wich lasted well for the rest of the drink This cinema is good but I would n t use it as my first choice as cinemas are a big part of me and the sound image and comfort are really important things to me for a great cinema experience  I do really like the screens outside so you can check the film that s showing before you go in it s a great idea and works well  picture taken as I left so shows film time of the showing after the one I watched  Original      I have n t been to a cinema in around    years i enjoyed my visit the person serving was friendly and really helpful we got are tickets and drinks we went for the large drinks because hey it s not a regular thing and might aswell go all out on it  The person scanning tickets could have been a bit more helpful I rely on things being made clear to me and because I seen the sign for screen one and not screen to as that was around the corner under the stairs it was difficult for me to understand wear it was the the person was friendly it would have been helpful to maby word and explain things a little different as some of us struggle with things like this also maybe move the sign for screen   so it can be seen as easy as screen   from wear the tickets get checked  The cinema was clean tidy and I really enjoyed the film we did notice that about of the way through many the Aircon came on or heating went off and started to get cold  We will be revisiting soon hopefully I really missed going to the cinema it was a really nice day out with going to the cinema at the end,1,updat went see matilda pm st decemb film good felt let qualiti sound realli flat minim bass especi music film paid extra premier seat whilst differ colour slightli higher back realli ai n t comfort start ach keep move seat get film whilst seat look good comfort n t consid made especi sit around hour pictur qualiti realli good good bright level notic intermitt imag reflect top right hang corner dark border around screen show part imag time film notic kept take focu away film realli would like see differ straw avail straw current go soggi collaps around minut film fail finish larg drink end use spare straw got back car showcas wich last well rest drink cinema good would n t use first choic cinema big part sound imag comfort realli import thing great cinema experi realli like screen outsid check film show go great idea work well pictur taken left show film time show one watch origin n t cinema around year enjoy visit person serv friendli realli help got ticket drink went larg drink hey not regular thing might aswel go person scan ticket could bit help reli thing made clear seen sign screen one not screen around corner stair difficult understand wear person friendli would help mabi word explain thing littl differ us struggl thing like also mayb move sign screen seen easi screen wear ticket get check cinema clean tidi realli enjoy film notic way mani aircon came heat went start get cold revisit soon hope realli miss go cinema realli nice day go cinema end

My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for    years  Needless to say I did not recognise much  After a quick walk and nice lunch  we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand  But I realised here too things were very different  This is the first time I have ever been to this brach  So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard  located the point where I scanned the store location barcode  My phone app was up and ready  Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere  my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out  Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex  this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone  In fact  I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store  if they were there  they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store  So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items  This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time  After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode  I paid for the shopping  We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode  Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode  So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt  The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt  How absolutely idiotic  So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services  Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter  picture attached  There was a person to the left of customer services  serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue  Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub  This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine  We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher  My friend better not get a parking ticket  As a store  in line with efficiency  you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app  You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store  Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter  the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers  Come on management  get your thinking cap on,0,friend park bromley sainsburi car park today visit high street not visit year needless say not recognis much quick walk nice lunch return sainsburi saw familiar site due brand realis thing differ first time ever brach got sainsburi app speak secur guard locat point scan store locat barcod phone app readi due limit time go elsewher friend pick item scan phone readi check unlik local sainsburi essex sainsburi not separ checkout peopl prescan time phone fact not come across hand held scanner store certainli not easili visibl one enter store queu peopl use self checkout scan item one one alreadi prescan item caus unnecessari delay us wast time transfer scan receipt across till use barcod paid shop took basket park meter scan till receipt barcod noth happen machin not read barcod ask person next us use machin scan receipt person advis us go insid get separ park receipt absolut idiot went queu consider time said custom servic unfortun no one custom servic counter pictur attach person left custom servic serv custom tobacco lotteri bale queue eventu turn got park ticket stub took friend scan machin wast much unnecessarili time quel pre scan basket checkout app well time wast look quel separ park voucher friend better not get park ticket store line effici serious look set separ checkout pre scan basket peopl use sainsburi app also given park voucher check shop till least advis someon big highlight sign need get anoth piec paper custom servic requir park meter exit store also realli need man custom servic counter not leav unattend mani staff member went past counter no one thought necessari foresight put serv member reliev queue tobacco lotteri counter ladi seem one total work serv custom come manag get think cap

At Mr Singh all vegetarian restaurant   takeaway vegetarians are treated to a delightful selection of meat free alternatives that rival their carnivorous counterparts  From hot dogs to chicken burgers  tandoori chicken style pizzas and delicious French fries  Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes  The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish  the chilli paneer pizza  which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite  which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu  While the food impresses  the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch  The d cor and furnishings appear dated  detracting slightly from the overall dining experience for those choosing to dine in restaurant  The Service is satisfactory but could be more attentive to elevate the dining experience further  As far as beverages go  Unfortunately  the milkshakes leave something to be desired  lacking the thick  creamy texture that milkshake aficionados crave  In conclusion  Mr Singh offers a vegetarian haven for those seeking flavorful meat free options  While there are areas for improvement  such as updating the ambiance and refining the milkshake offerings  the delicious food makes it a worthwhile dining destination for vegetarians and meat eaters alike  I go as far as saying in terms of takeaway pizzas it possibly up there as one of the best in the midlands   surrounding areas,1,mr singh vegetarian restaur takeaway vegetarian treat delight select meat free altern rival carnivor counterpart hot dog chicken burger tandoori chicken style pizza delici french fri mr singh offer divers menu cater vegetarian tast four star rate given larg attribut standout dish chilli paneer pizza boast perfect blend spice cheesi tantal tast bud everi bite opinion highlight mr singh menu food impress ambianc could benefit modern touch cor furnish appear date detract slightli overal dine experi choos dine restaur servic satisfactori could attent elev dine experi far beverag go unfortun milkshak leav someth desir lack thick creami textur milkshak aficionado crave conclus mr singh offer vegetarian seek flavor meat free option area improv updat ambianc refin milkshak offer delici food make worthwhil dine destin vegetarian meat eater alik go far say term takeaway pizza possibl one best midland surround area

Went for an early dinner during the week  The thing that immediately hits u is the cleanliness which is incredibly high  People are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters  We ordered from a menu in Chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food  Despite the reputation of the Sichuan region of China I must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way  One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate  Food is actually abundant  well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in  I recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent Cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon,1,went earli dinner week thing immedi hit u cleanli incred high peopl friendli relax custom waiter order menu chines make easier understand actual food despit reput sichuan region china must say flavour everi dish tri seem sedat blander way one expect explos flavour assault sens china flavour civilis adapt less fieri palat food actual abund well cook balanc pleasur dine recommend want tri someth differ omnipres cantones restaur citi without risk becom fire breath dragon

Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise  marked by affordability and hearty portions  Although the name eludes my memory  the overall experience left a lasting impression  The cafe proved to be a budget friendly haven  offering a range of options without denting the wallet  We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal  enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank  The portions were generous  a welcome sight for voracious appetites  The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly  exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration  The affordability to portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience  The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare  While the flavors were commendable  the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration  Despite the minor crispiness setback  the food resonated well with my hunger stricken state  The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect  ensuring an enjoyable meal  It s a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price  Regrettably  the cafe name escapes my recollection  hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center  The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits  A hidden gem indeed  awaiting a more memorable encore    WakefieldCafeExperience   AffordableEats,1,inaugur visit cafe wakefield citi center unfold pleasant surpris mark afford hearti portion although name elud memori overal experi left last impress cafe prove budget friendli offer rang option without dent wallet opt burger meal hot wing meal entic promis satisfi hunger without break bank portion gener welcom sight voraci appetit burger meal hot wing meal arriv promptli exud tempt aroma hint flavor await explor afford portion ratio set stage promis fulfil dine experi first bite reveal commend effort craft enjoy fare flavor commend lack satisfi crunch notabl point consider despit minor crispi setback food reson well hunger stricken state savori note ampl portion compens nuanc aspect ensur enjoy meal testament cafe abil deliv fundament promis satiat hunger afford price regrett cafe name escap recollect hinder abil give due credit hidden gem wakefield citi center overal enjoy food satisfact well fed appetit make establish contend futur visit hidden gem inde await memor encor wakefieldcafeexperi affordableeat

This TGI Fridays in Telford provided a consistently enjoyable dining experience  As a fan of American cuisine  I found their menu to be diverse and satisfying  From the moment I walked in  the energetic and lively atmosphere immediately set the tone for a fun dining experience  The staff at TGI Fridays were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit  Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu  assisting us in making our choices  They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant  The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes  including burgers  ribs  and flavorful appetizers  We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger  which came with a generous side of crispy fries  The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors  and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match  The portion size was satisfying  leaving us feeling fully satisfied  In terms of ambiance  TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere  The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music  creating a celebratory atmosphere  The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia  further enhancing the overall experience  The only reason I am not giving a five star rating is the occasional long wait time  especially during peak hours  However  the staff did their best to manage the crowd efficiently and keep waiting times to a minimum  Nevertheless  it s advisable to book a table in advance to avoid any potential delays  Despite the wait  TGI Fridays in Telford consistently delivers a reliable dining experience  The food is consistently flavorful  the service is attentive  and the environment is vibrant  Whether you are looking for a casual meal or a place to celebrate with friends  TGI Fridays is a great choice  I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you re in the area and craving some delicious American fare,1,tgi friday telford provid consist enjoy dine experi fan american cuisin found menu divers satisfi moment walk energet live atmospher immedi set tone fun dine experi staff tgi friday welcom attent throughout visit server friendli excel knowledg menu assist us make choic patient cater request ensur dine experi pleasant menu offer varieti classic american dish includ burger rib flavor appet decid tri jack daniel burger came gener side crispi fri burger juici pack delici flavor combin smoki jack daniel glaze crispi bacon perfect match portion size satisfi leav us feel fulli satisfi term ambianc tgi friday exud vibrant live atmospher spaciou seat area complement upbeat music creat celebratori atmospher wall adorn variou memorabilia ad touch nostalgia enhanc overal experi reason not give five star rate occasion long wait time especi peak hour howev staff best manag crowd effici keep wait time minimum nevertheless advis book tabl advanc avoid potenti delay despit wait tgi friday telford consist deliv reliabl dine experi food consist flavor servic attent environ vibrant whether look casual meal place celebr friend tgi friday great choic would definit recommend give tri area crave delici american fare

Been here many times and this review should be   stars  however today as I am writing this review  I have not just taken into consideration the product  Coffee   but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit  as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n t it   The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served    stars for this  Today it was busy in this branch of Costa  Vision Retail Park  Hartlepool  and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there  This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves  The coffee machines were dirty  the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around  along with it being very dirty for the customers to see   Pictures attached to the review   Interestingly  the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone  and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout  My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink   Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out   The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there  Despite today visit being a kind of   scruffy   experience with Costa  I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings  Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further,0,mani time review star howev today write review not taken consider product coffe also taken consider messi workplac staff work give true review reflect visit review suppos n t coffe costa everywher go know expect get serv star today busi branch costa vision retail park hartlepool staff seem push durat obvious led corner cut term cleanli floor coffe machin coffe machin dirti floor unhygien behind counter brush thing laid around along dirti custom see pictur attach review interestingli steamer milk wipe use everyon no steam blown pipe expel milk may gotten spout question would someon dairi allergi spout use serv someon normal milk expel normal milk drink sure clean short blast steam use would sort potenti issu staff polit accommod found everi visit branch costa kudo team despit today visit kind scruffi experi costa back handi place conduct meet perhap costa invest staff resourc known busi time custom experi heighten

The food was amazing  Both the pies and the fries were fresh made  The ambiance was lively and enjoyable  and the decoration is an experience in itself  However  our experience was definitely affected by our server  She was very rude  and repeatedly rushed us  We had just arrived  and as we were taking our coats off  she asked if we were ready to order  She then came again  not two minutes after that  and asked once again  By the third time  when we hurried to choose so as to not be pressured again  she quickly responded   Thank God   when we said we were ready  She then proceeded to ask us to leave  when she saw we had finished our food  but I guess she must not have noticed we still had our drinks  I would still go back  The place is located beautifully  and the food was good  It is definitely an experience worth doing while visiting Canterbury,1,food amaz pie fri fresh made ambianc live enjoy decor experi howev experi definit affect server rude repeatedli rush us arriv take coat ask readi order came not two minut ask third time hurri choos not pressur quickli respond thank god said readi proceed ask us leav saw finish food guess must not notic still drink would still go back place locat beauti food good definit experi worth visit canterburi

the coffee itself was very disappointing  It lacked any depth or flavor and tasted like it had been watered down  It was almost as if I was drinking warm brown water instead of a good cup of coffee  I was expecting a more robust and flavorful coffee from a popular bakery chain like Greggs  but unfortunately  I was let down  To make matters worse  the lid of my coffee cup was extremely greasy  It was as if it had been touched with oily hands before being placed on my cup,0,coffe disappoint lack depth flavor tast like water almost drink warm brown water instead good cup coffe expect robust flavor coffe popular bakeri chain like gregg unfortun let make matter wors lid coffe cup extrem greasi touch oili hand place cup

Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes  I was pleasantly surprised  The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked  The crust golden  like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach  Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect  Secondly  the cheese was there  Usually I am second guessing myself  wondering if I had accidentally clicked the  Extra Dough  option when ordering  rather than extra cheese  This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency something that I wo n t deduct points for  Anyway  having a few slices with a bit less cheese  knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal  The sauce was plenty ladled  and because the pizza was n t overcooked  the toppings were juicy and tender  Remember  if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop  I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves  or they just care about their customers  All in all  great experience,1,went whim order despit previou abysm experi pizza hut hay pleasantli surpris first thing notic pizza not overcook crust golden like soak ray picturesqu caribbean beach perfectli moist spongi one would expect secondli chees usual second guess wonder accident click extra dough option order rather extra chees time visibl slid across surfac pizza transit due sheer weight consist someth wo n t deduct point anyway slice bit less chees know go reach absolut coat came quit excit almost tens ordeal sauc plenti ladl pizza n t overcook top juici tender rememb want pepperoni crisp buy shop guess time person prepar pizza connoisseur care custom great experi
