"The last Gov report showed the cost to the UK of reoffending was around 18 billion a year. 

The same statistics put the cost of housing a prisoner each year somewhere around 50k.

In the UK currently we have 95k people in prison.

Let’s say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.

People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can’t. It’s not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.

The whole myth around increased punishment isn’t a deterrent argument falls apart as well when scrutinised. How many of you would walk down the streets in the UK and smoke a joint? - Not worried about it right.. - Now how many of you would do the same in Singapore or Dubai? - Not so willing to are you, why? - Because you are shit scared of the consequences there, don’t nobody want to go to a Dubai Jail.

">The other one who said the commission- does he expect brokers to work for free? 

No one expects the broker to work for free. But you don't need a PhD in behavioural economics to understand that, if a service is chosen by a party which not only doesn't pay the bill, but gets a cut, then the result will be inflated prices.

The problem here is not that the broker gets a commission - it is that insurance commissions are shared between brokers and managing agents/freeholders. But the bill is paid by the leaseholders.

This creates an incentive to choose the more expensive policy, if it pays a higher commission.

He replied *“no I’m from Brazil…but?…so?… you’re not Portuguese”*
I didn’t understand what he meant though so I asked him why he thought I was Portuguese.

He said *“your pronunciation was 100% Portuguese it sounded native so I was excited to have a colleague who was a Portuguese speaker but then I turned to see a small English girl (thanks) and you don’t even look 1/2 Portuguese it make no sense to me! Your *hola* in Spanish was pronounced very very wrong, but for Portuguese it’s perfect, I’m impressed!”*

All went well when interest rates were low until covid hit, suddenly everyone was working from home and their tenants started defaulting on lease/rent payments as well as interest rates jumping.
Statutory obligations are also increasing with smaller budgets and Westminster expects everyone to do more with less.

"It's because it includes payments from private pensions too. Pensions are basically treated as normal income taxable income.

Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.

The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.

We really don't need policies giving loads of cash to wealthy old people who don't contribute to productivity.",0,it is because it includes payments from private pensions too pensions are basically treated as normal income taxable income personally i think it is absolutely insane this is even being discussed what should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor the reasons why removing this tax is insane it primarily benefits wealthy pensioners it is a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year of their retirement shifts even more tax burden to young people who provably have higher living expenses rent transport student loans than most all pensioners young people probably will not get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach we really do not need policies giving loads of cash to wealthy old people who do not contribute to productivity,includes payment private pension pension basically treated normal income taxable income personally think absolutely insane even discussed happening income tax band move upwards specifically benefit people cash poor reason removing tax insane primarily benefit wealthy pensioner massive gaping hole cash rich people funnel money take gigantic tax free pension payment year retirement shift even tax burden young people provably higher living expense rent transport student loan pensioner young people probably not get deal pension age get yanked reach really not need policy giving load cash wealthy old people not contribute productivity

"Getting an apprenticeship changed my life. I was working a dead end career as a chef and an apprenticeship gave me a lifeline into the power industry. I really consider them valuable for the country and are an excellent policy for people who traditionally couldn't afford university (the middle working class, where maintenance funding and grants fall majorly short and parents could never afford to support them). For an extra year or two on a course, an apprentice comes out with the same academic qualifications but 4-5 years industrial experience. I highly recommend people trying to get on one.




I support most of Labour’s policies, however I have to agree with the tories on this one and perhaps lean into the lib dems idea being the best. Rather than extracting funds for retraining, there should be additional funding. I can only see unscrupulous business (which is most) using this to utilise the apprenticeship levy to pay for routine staff training, likely redesigned as an in house delivery so individuals don't even get external certification to utilise.",1,getting an apprenticeship changed my life i was working a dead end career as a chef and an apprenticeship gave me a lifeline into the power industry i really consider them valuable for the country and are an excellent policy for people who traditionally could not afford university the middle working class where maintenance funding and grants fall majorly short and parents could never afford to support them for an extra year or two on a course an apprentice comes out with the same academic qualifications but years industrial experience i highly recommend people trying to get on one i support most of labour s policies however i have to agree with the tories on this one and perhaps lean into the lib dems idea being the best rather than extracting funds for retraining there should be additional funding i can only see unscrupulous business which is most using this to utilise the apprenticeship levy to pay for routine staff training likely redesigned as an in house delivery so individuals do not even get external certification to utilise,getting apprenticeship changed life working dead end career chef apprenticeship gave lifeline power industry really consider valuable country excellent policy people traditionally could not afford university middle working class maintenance funding grant fall majorly short parent could never afford support extra year two course apprentice come academic qualification year industrial experience highly recommend people trying get one support labour policy however agree tory one perhaps lean lib dems idea best rather extracting fund retraining additional funding see unscrupulous business using utilise apprenticeship levy pay routine staff training likely redesigned house delivery individual not even get external certification utilise

"This is really about the reputation of the police. 

I'd love to be able to assume that the police wouldn't set a dog on someone without good reason.

Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.

I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge. I think it's also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers - probably most of them - would happily look the other way while that happened. I would expect this to be more likely if the guy had scorned the police officers involved, because they're extremely protective of their own hurt feelings, but that's another issue altogether.

I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.

The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it.

Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.

The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.

Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit £3 trillion. (£3,000,000,000,000).
It was about £1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.







If anyone is interested, i am setting up a petition to deport the Conservative party to Rwanda, it probably won't happen, but it will give the civil service a laugh.

"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.",0,there are doctors in my surgery to cover over people and i feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum s death my mum was not a well woman she had ms and was bed bound had carers coming in to see her times a day and after my dad passed in november the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and i failed her for the last few months of her life she had constant uti s and was in a constant state of confusion with them no doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out one morning i had to phone as i could not get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her long story short i had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis i thought i was leaving her in good hands and i needed to help my brother in law with my nephews anyhoo hours after being taken she was discharged a subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper i mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she would not have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if i wanted her in hospital i said i just wanted what was best for my mum she gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum was not one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another uti five days later my mum passed due to sepsis,doctor surgery cover people feel understaffing played part mum death mum not well woman m bed bound carers coming see time day dad passed november rest time take care failed last month life constant uti constant state confusion no doctor came see despite phone practice every week couple time advanced nurse practitioner came one morning phone could not get wake ended perform chest compression long story short leave hour sister taken hospital day almost passed night due sepsis thought leaving good hand needed help brother law nephew anyhoo hour taken discharged subsequent conversation advanced nurse practitioner mum found eating tissue paper mentioned hospital practitioner said would not discharged anything wrong asked wanted hospital said wanted best mum gave mum said could treat front despite saying mum not one snacking fucking tissue paper anyway another antibiotic prescribed probably another uti five day later mum passed due sepsis

We had heard their prices were reasonable and decided to give them a try, but walking in we almost walked out again. The venue looked tacky, the table we sat at by the window was covered in crumbs which we decided to wipe off with a tissue. We had a look at the sticky menus on the table and decided on our breakfasts. The staff were friendly. The hot chocolate from the dispensing machine das weak but the cappuccino was good. Breakfast was served with a smile and was very fresh and tasty. Will definately try another branch.",1,very impressed with the food we had to drop our car at the mechanic and decided to walk around to find a breakfast spot when we stumbled upon weatherspoons we had heard their prices were reasonable and decided to give them a try but walking in we almost walked out again the venue looked tacky the table we sat at by the window was covered in crumbs which we decided to wipe off with a tissue we had a look at the sticky menus on the table and decided on our breakfasts the staff were friendly the hot chocolate from the dispensing machine das weak but the cappuccino was good breakfast was served with a smile and was very fresh and tasty will definately try another branch,impressed food drop car mechanic decided walk around find breakfast spot stumbled upon weatherspoons heard price reasonable decided give try walking almost walked venue looked tacky table sat window covered crumb decided wipe tissue look sticky menu table decided breakfast staff friendly hot chocolate dispensing machine da weak cappuccino good breakfast served smile fresh tasty definately try another branch

"On the face, a tired 1920s hotel with splendid views of Brighton seafront. With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n’t like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n’t underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms. If you looking for the wow factor, do n’t stay here. If you looking a nice attentive hotel experience where you are looked after and get a good night sleep, this may be the place for you.

"Worst customer service I encountered in years. Red, raw and at best, pink in parts chicken, not at all stringy or cooked, literally dunked in the frier and removed and served in the time that I washed my hands. Lord is my witness, we ordered, washed my hands without using the toilet I should point out, returned and food was served. Granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse. The incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all I met with. I politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly / remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said ‘ just you can have refund ’. Eventually they remade the food, which unsurprisingly took 3-4x longer to make and was actually cooked through. I never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain. Issues with food are understandable, but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different, and furthermore, to degrade them, and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube, not stringy white chicken, and is uncooked, followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n’t know your managers name when politely asked whom I can address my concerns to given the food was shocking.",0,worst customer service i encountered in years red raw and at best pink in parts chicken not at all stringy or cooked literally dunked in the frier and removed and served in the time that i washed my hands lord is my witness we ordered washed my hands without using the toilet i should point out returned and food was served granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse the incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all i met with i politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said just you can have refund eventually they remade the food which unsurprisingly took x longer to make and was actually cooked through i never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain issues with food are understandable but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different and furthermore to degrade them and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube not stringy white chicken and is uncooked followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n t know your managers name when politely asked whom i can address my concerns to given the food was shocking,worst customer service encountered year red raw best pink part chicken not stringy cooked literally dunked frier removed served time washed hand lord witness ordered washed hand without using toilet point returned food served granted close closing time no excuse incredibly rude waitress decided shutting suggesting refund everyone say red colouring marinade no problem take refund met politely declined offer refund asked cooked properly remade lady nodded seemingly acknowledgement said refund eventually remade food unsurprisingly took x longer make actually cooked never made feel like someone shutting customer really not one complain issue food understandable argue needlessly paying customer entirely different furthermore degrade pretend understand telling say red pink solid cube not stringy white chicken uncooked followed slamming customer complaint email table asked detail also suggesting n t know manager name politely asked address concern given food shocking
"I had booked a table for last night and when we arrived it was a lovely night with my partner. We had a great time but I do have to admit the prices of the drinks were on the expensive side. Seventeen pounds for two double gins and lemonade when you can buy the bottle for the amount we had( we only had three or four of that) and it was a little painful to pay that price but it is what it is. We liked the reserved area and enjoyed all the free goodies they gave us and the staff were lovely.

"The staff were very enthusiastic and friendly. For appetizers, we ordered summer rolls, chicken wings, and baby squid. They were very appetizing and delicious, with normal portion sizes, not too small. The only drawback was that the seasoning sprinkled on the chicken wings was very salty. As for the Pho, the broth met the standard, but the amount of meat slices was very small. I ordered the beef combo and still had at least three large meatballs to satisfy me, but my husband beef and garlic pho hardly had any meat. However, because the flavors were very good, we would be willing to visit again to try other dishes.",1,the staff were very enthusiastic and friendly for appetizers we ordered summer rolls chicken wings and baby squid they were very appetizing and delicious with normal portion sizes not too small the only drawback was that the seasoning sprinkled on the chicken wings was very salty as for the pho the broth met the standard but the amount of meat slices was very small i ordered the beef combo and still had at least three large meatballs to satisfy me but my husband beef and garlic pho hardly had any meat however because the flavors were very good we would be willing to visit again to try other dishes,staff enthusiastic friendly appetizer ordered summer roll chicken wing baby squid appetizing delicious normal portion size not small drawback seasoning sprinkled chicken wing salty pho broth met standard amount meat slice small ordered beef combo still least three large meatball satisfy husband beef garlic pho hardly meat however flavor good would willing visit try dish

The staff were polite and helpful is the best I can say. The order was wrong for our food and the rib eye steak was the worst I've had in 20 years.

I'd rather not waste is so I smothered it in sauce but it was quite quite bad. I presume it was a new chef.

"A great bar, with great food in the hub, Milton Keynes. Brewdog has a large selection of beers-the staple Brewdog beers, and some exciting guest beers and ciders to accompany them. There are also some more ‘ exotic( expensive) ’ cans in the fridges next to the bar, which are always interesting to try. I usually grab a few to share. The food is great-the Buffalo Chicken Burger is a big favourite and the service is usually brilliant. This time, however, one main from our order was completely forgotten and then when reminded( 10 minutes after the other 2 dishes had come out), the wrong burger was delivered and so everyone else had finished and needed to leave before I got my food! At the point of ordering there was also a few things not available, but with no signage / notes to let people know. The table gives you a QR code to order food / drink from, however after selecting everything and attempting to check out, it flags an error. This happened for all 3 of us.

"Horrible attitude from the main lady, no sense of good customer service right off the bat! The food is barely edible, no flavour at best.

Burn of the pot taste! Mean ole auntie ca n't cook The plantains were just allright, still no flavour though. Only saving grace was the price which is fair for the portions. Hence 2 stars and not zero. Of course, price is not shown anywhere, they just make it up on the fly and add a few more pounds to the total that they swear is part of the original deal. The 2 consistently ask customers to take off their face masks to order as they claim they ca n't hear through it. Absolute negligence in times of rampant Omicron variant!! I respectfully refused and immediately this one unprofessional main lady throws her hands up at the ceiling, kiss her teeth at me and displays other terribly immature, rude attitude urging her employee to deal with me because of it. Mind you, i caught a cold and did n't want to risk coughing in their faces but i guess that's just me.

"I've always been a sainsburys shopper but the Loughborough branch needs some improvements. Just about all the trolleys have stiff wheels or make a racket. The lady on the self checkouts on Monday mornings puts a lot more importance on her conversation with friend colleague than customers, and you often have to wait at the self checkout for alcohol or whatever to be approved even when there are hardly any customers. This week I used self scan as usual and at the checkout it lost my entire shop. I tried to get the attention of the supervisor but she was chatting as usual so I wheeled my trolley to the kiosk but no one was there. I could have just walked out with my unpaid for shopping. I went back and interrupted the supervisor and told her what had happened. She was dismissive and said it had happened to someone else that morning and the only thing to do was to scan it all again. Bearing in mind it was all neatly packed into bags! Annoying enough but she was n't even remotely apologetic. Just went back to chatting. It's a good job for sainsburys that I have a conscience as I was so annoyed I felt like just nicking the whole lot.

"A very pleasant café-bakery offering a fair amount of seating inside. The popularity of this place means that there are often long queues to buy bread. As for the quality of the pastries and croissants, they are very tasty and come in different versions, sweet and salty. Coffee and tea are good, but nothing special. The bread is fresh and crunchy, I recommend the San Francisco Sourdough Bread.

"Went in for a Sunday Lunch, without booking, but luckily there was some seating available outside in the marquee. A little bit strange to order and pay for your drinks at the bar but then to order and pay for your food with the server separately, but it was fine, just not we used to. There was a bit of a wait for the server, Karen, to take our food order, but it was busy with some couples ahead of us, so it was understandable and Karen was SO friendly and bubbly, nothing fazed her. When the food arrived and we got stuck in it was worth they wait, my husband had pork and gammon and I had beef, the meats were perfectly tender and delicious with great roasties, large Yorkshire and side veggies.

"Lovely little nook in the basement of an old church. One of the coolest places in Oxford location-wise to have a meal. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. I enjoyed the carrot and red lentil soup, vegan Oxford breakfast, and fruit scone. Given that the vegan breakfast is the same price as the non vegan one and has food taken out(, eggs, sausage), I felt like it could have included more of the beans and veggies. My portion of beans was just a handful of beans. But flavor wise it was delicious. Especially the bread! Their homemade scone was also fantastic. Drink-wise I tried their teas and chai latte and did not find them great. Service is friendly but unhurried.

So after scanning my shopping, she said you need to place your card in the reader. I told her that I do n't have my card and that I will need to use another checkout. She told me you will just have to leave your shopping as the contactless is not working. The fact that the contactless is not working, should have been made very clear and it was not. There were no notices informing customers that there was a problem with the contactless payment machines. She said that the staff were informing customers verbally, which is not true.

"Went on a tuesday night for a meal, it turned out this was Steak Night. It turned out to be Mistake Night. I ordered a Sirloin steak, rare, with all the options. No complaints about the chips, mushroom, peas, etc. but the sauce was cold, The steak had two extremely tough pieces of tissue running through it. These were so tough I could n't cut through them with the steak knife. These should have been trimmed out before cooking. I was left trying to cut out the edible meat from between the two lines. I think I managed to eat about half the steak. The meal was cheap, but with proper butchery could have been good.

"Wonderful to have this type of museum in Sheffield and it does a lot of things right, plenty of free games for people to try and interesting items from video game history in cabinets to look at, felt like they were really support local indie developers also. But, some simple things like having working controllers would be nice, even something common and fairly cheap like a SNES pad was n’t replaced and broken, Zool is a hard enough game without using a broken controller. Did n’t feel like it was laid out in any chronological order either, would have been to show my child the early stuff and walked them through how it progressed to modern day.

"I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene! I visited with my wife the second time, we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries, which came to. We wo n't be back.",0,i love a burger and have now tried five guys twice i was disappointed after my first visit but awarded them stars i wanted to give them a second try but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to stars the quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings like mcdonalds or burger king however the cost is to times the price of mcdonalds consistent but a bit bland or burger king prone to inconsistency in delivery service and grubby restaurants but tasty burgers this would be tolerable but the five guys burgers are immensely bland they lack seasoning or any beefy flavour they have no sear on the outside the bacon is crispy but this appears to be achieved by deep frying it has a suitably uniform colour which gives the bacon a scorched flavour it is also unsmoked a lost opportunity to make it tastier the portions of fries are generous but i would rather pay half the price for half the quantity the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you would want to inflate prices the fries are also a bit over seasoned the premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless high quality and above all delicious offering yet it falls significantly short of this it is n t bad but better can be had for significantly less for my first visit i spent for a burger fries and a milkshake which is frankly obscene i visited with my wife the second time we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries which came to we wo n t be back,love burger tried five guy twice disappointed first visit awarded star wanted give second try found offering unfortunately consistent dropped rating star quality ingredient bit better standard fast food offering like mcdonalds burger king however cost time price mcdonalds consistent bit bland burger king prone inconsistency delivery service grubby restaurant tasty burger would tolerable five guy burger immensely bland lack seasoning beefy flavour no sear outside bacon crispy appears achieved deep frying suitably uniform colour give bacon scorched flavour also unsmoked lost opportunity make tastier portion fry generous would rather pay half price half quantity generosity probably cynical technique sell would want inflate price fry also bit seasoned premium price give impression faultless high quality delicious offering yet fall significantly short n t bad better significantly less first visit spent burger fry milkshake frankly obscene visited wife second time bacon cheeseburger shared small fry came wo n t back

There is a hair dryer, iron & board, kettle & tea / coffee, big TV and lots of power points. There is a coffee machine in reception that is free to use for guests. There is a small bar and vending machine but we did n't purchase anything from either. We came into the hotel via the lift from the car park. Car park cost paid at reception is 15 for when you arrive till midnight the following day. Checkout is at 12 noon so we put our luggage in the car and went out for lunch and shopping before heading home To get to the hotel by car you will most likely have to come through the clean air zone, I was driving a hybrid so there was no charge. Though I had to check online to be sure as I'm not well versed in the zone charges and rules etc. The location of the hotel is really good, about a 5-10 minute walk to shops / restaurants.

This was not met with understanding, nor apology for the consistent error: just “ ask for a top up when they bring it out ”.

Ordered 3 meals, confirmed the 3 meals about 2-3 times( due to the difficulty in communication), and even then they tried to trick us numerous times. Price paid never matches their menu, they forget items until you remind them, and they try to say you've paid XX amount less than you need to to get you to pay again.

"Ridiculously overpriced food-you can get better at KFC for less. Was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at Wingstop sounded very tasty on the board. I ordered the box of 8 boneless chicken, fries with the Wingstop flavoring and a drink. What was served up however, was mediocre, the chicken was just warm and did n't contain much sauce on them. In the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring-mine arrived with a dash of flavour. I do have to say the Brazilian and Mango Habanero sauces were good though. The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again.

"For a budget cinema, it's pretty fantastic. For reference, I've actually been to both an expensive cinema( Luxe Birmingham Broadway Plaza) and now a budget one.

The seats are n't as comfortable but the screen size is the same.

"Unfortunately very disappointed by the food. The dynamite shrimp was nice, and the pieces were big, but the masala I forgot to take a picture of) were meagre. The Dum biryani was just-and the Szechuan noodles were also fine. But the chilli garlic prawns were SO underwhelming with barely any flavour in the gravy, and the white rice I ordered was stale and hard to eat.

"Was told just after our food arrived using table service that we only had 30 mins, as they were shutting the upstairs where we were seated. Twenty-five mins later, a younger member of staff came over and said we need to leave now. He had also told a number of other customers the same. As me and my friend still had our coffee to finish, I said that we would be on our way, as soon as we had finished. This clearly put him and his teams back up, as they headed over to the corner area we were seated and began picking up stools to very heavy handedly dropping them on the tables. The team began to make comments amongst themselves about getting the job done. After a few more mins, we were ready to leave and as we did, I was issued a few very sarcastic have a good evenings by the team. At the bottom of the stairs was the manager, who said they'd just dealt with a technical issue and very confusingly said that was why upstairs was shut, but it was all sorted now. I did mention to him about the rudeness of a few of his staff. Before we left, my friend placed a large takeaway order for both our families at home, only to get home with the said order and a number of food items missing.

We compared the prices with the Wrexham one and the Cheshire oaks one and Wrexham was much cheaper for the same thing! ? The drinks and service were pretty good, loads of bowling balls available and the game itself was fun-the kids loved it. Did n't eat there as we went next door to nandos so I ca n't comment on the food. The arcade section was pretty good as well. We and the kids had a few games of air hockey before leaving.

"First time visiting Fratello and was very impressed by the warm, genuine greeting on arrival, the quick service and the great pizzas. Will be definitely visiting again in the very near future! October update: Seafood risotto and seafood tagliatelle ordered. Both slightly underwhelming in flavour with far too much very rubbery and flavourless octopus in the seafood mixture. Had to pick it all out in the end as there was just too much of it( see photo). Even with lots of chilli oil( which was very mild indeed) and pepper, both dishes were rather disappointing. Jan 2024 A third visit delivered with fabulous pizzas though the server seemed very confused when I asked for no ham on the quattro pizza as it's supposed to be in 4 sections... Just add more of the other ingredients, I do n't mind which one, just not ham( hence my quattro became tre!). Would definitely recommend for their pizzas!",1,first time visiting fratello and was very impressed by the warm genuine greeting on arrival the quick service and the great pizzas will be definitely visiting again in the very near future october update seafood risotto and seafood tagliatelle ordered both slightly underwhelming in flavour with far too much very rubbery and flavourless octopus in the seafood mixture had to pick it all out in the end as there was just too much of it see photo even with lots of chilli oil which was very mild indeed and pepper both dishes were rather disappointing jan a third visit delivered with fabulous pizzas though the server seemed very confused when i asked for no ham on the quattro pizza as it is supposed to be in sections just add more of the other ingredients i do n t mind which one just not ham hence my quattro became tre would definitely recommend for their pizzas,first time visiting fratello impressed warm genuine greeting arrival quick service great pizza definitely visiting near future october update seafood risotto seafood tagliatelle ordered slightly underwhelming flavour far much rubbery flavourless octopus seafood mixture pick end much see photo even lot chilli oil mild indeed pepper dish rather disappointing jan third visit delivered fabulous pizza though server seemed confused asked no ham quattro pizza supposed section add ingredient n t mind one not ham hence quattro became tre would definitely recommend pizza

"Great location, free parking for guests, friendly reception staff. Room was a bit dated but perfectly adequate for the price. Unfortunately I did n't sleep well as I was disturbed by constant noise from the extractor fans on the flat roof outside my window, but I'm a light sleeper and at least I was n't on the railway station side which would have been a lot worse. Sadly my stay came to an unpleasant end on the morning I checked out. I had gone to bed with the do not disturb sign on the door and the chain across, despite this at there was a knock on the door and it was the chambermaid telling me I had to check out at 11 am. I said yes, 11 am-it's. Instead of apologizing and saying she would come back at 11, she then tried to barge her way into my room! Persistently and very aggressively. If the chain had n't been across she would have been in the room with me only partially dressed.

"We only ever ordered takeaway from this branch since the pandemic and last night was the first time we decided to dine in at the behest of a 4yr old However, he burst out crying( softly) on hearing there a wait so we decided to go elsewhere as he was very hungry. The staff absolutely wasted no time in trying their best to find a table for us. Rest of the evening was spent on some delicious food and impeccable service during such busy peak hours. Special mentions-Steve, Hemant and Crystal, however every staff member was on the best foot forward that day and I have n’t seen tht in a long time!

"We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant. This was the first time to Hearth after hearing good things and seeing the positive reviews. It was also a nostalgia trip, being an avid diner in Studio cafe back in the 90s when a student at the Art College in Hull in my youth. The restaurant has a simple, stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine. It also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff. We were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen. The service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks, but the main course food service was fairly slow. We decided on 2 courses and waited 45 minutes after ordering for our mains, which did seem too long. Desserts arrived much quicker, within 10 minutes The food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food( which seems to be the new bar set for Michelin guide rated food these days... as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society). Portions are generous, and Sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful. A special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion' pudding', which was deemed' the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside. The only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food, as all savoury courses and gravy did seem VERY salty. We would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating. Also, identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff, when ordering or any mention. For example, one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the( enormous) yorkshire pudding, and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free. Which was confirmed. Desserts were excellent, with interesting menu choices, and, again, generous portions. We would return, as the overall experience was enjoyable, but maybe to try the evening menu next time..",1,we enjoyed a lovely sunday lunch in this buzzing popular restaurant this was the first time to hearth after hearing good things and seeing the positive reviews it was also a nostalgia trip being an avid diner in studio cafe back in the s when a student at the art college in hull in my youth the restaurant has a simple stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine it also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff we were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen the service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks but the main course food service was fairly slow we decided on courses and waited minutes after ordering for our mains which did seem too long desserts arrived much quicker within minutes the food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food which seems to be the new bar set for michelin guide rated food these days as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society portions are generous and sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful a special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion pudding which was deemed the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside the only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food as all savoury courses and gravy did seem very salty we would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating also identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff when ordering or any mention for example one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the enormous yorkshire pudding and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free which was confirmed desserts were excellent with interesting menu choices and again generous portions we would return as the overall experience was enjoyable but maybe to try the evening menu next time,enjoyed lovely sunday lunch buzzing popular restaurant first time hearth hearing good thing seeing positive review also nostalgia trip avid diner studio cafe back student art college hull youth restaurant simple stylish interior pleasant environment dine also appears well organised abundance service staff seated upstairs restaurant seated opposite open kitchen service attentive staff ordering checking drink main course food service fairly slow decided course waited minute ordering main seem long dessert arrived much quicker within minute food quality good homestyle rustic comfort food seems new bar set michelin guide rated food day home cooked food becomes less norm society portion generous sunday lunch trimming plentiful special note meatloaf style sage onion pudding deemed roast potato perfectly crisp outside fluffy inside disappointment seasoning food savoury course gravy seem salty would preferred less salty taste felt thirsty several hour eating also identifying allergy dietary requirement not determined upfront staff ordering mention example one fish main course arrived table gravy already poured enormous yorkshire pudding query waitress gravy meat free confirmed dessert excellent interesting menu choice generous portion would return overall experience enjoyable maybe try evening menu next time

"I made my first ever clubbing visit here as a fresh 18 year old a week ago and they really put the bar high. It seems people have had bad experiences with the door staff, but I disagree with what has been said about them. Admittedly I did show up pretty much as soon as they opened, so crowds were n't an issue, maybe that is the difference for others. I was thoroughly searched( which I am happy with) and even had a little chat with the door staff, telling them it was my first time visiting and he even gave a bit of a "" pep "" talk-it was lovely! I made the mistake of not brining my student ID, so I payed 11 pounds for entry, not 4, but oh well, still the price I was expecting anyways. I had a couple of drinks across the evening. They tasted good, but I'm convinced the vodka was watered down, as my drinks tasted a bit too bearable haha. Mixed feelings about the bar staff, some seemed quite fed up, but others seemed friendly. It was nice to see a range of different people from different backgrounds working in there. A good presence of security and welfare staff throughout the venue made it feel very safe, and the atmosphere was brilliant once it started to get busy. Everybody seemed to be having a really good time. When you leave, the cloakroom is a bit chaotic, but if you wait patiently you get through it eventually.

Very very very basic No jug kettle in the room. Very tight spaces. Although reasonably clean. If you are driving will have to pay 3 per day for the parking.

"Clean takeaway with welcoming, polite staff. The food at Pepe took me by surprise-it's actually pretty decent. The chicken portions are big and the price is really reasonable. The flavours are also great too, with quite a range to choose from. My only gripe with this place is that the mango and lime tasted super artificial. I mean, when I was eating my mango and lime wings, I could quite literally feel the grains of powdered flavour on my tongue. The marinade tasted really grainy. Aside from the mango and lime sauce, the other sauces I tried were decent. Overall, a decent spot.",1,clean takeaway with welcoming polite staff the food at pepe took me by surprise it is actually pretty decent the chicken portions are big and the price is really reasonable the flavours are also great too with quite a range to choose from my only gripe with this place is that the mango and lime tasted super artificial i mean when i was eating my mango and lime wings i could quite literally feel the grains of powdered flavour on my tongue the marinade tasted really grainy aside from the mango and lime sauce the other sauces i tried were decent overall a decent spot,clean takeaway welcoming polite staff food pepe took surprise actually pretty decent chicken portion big price really reasonable flavour also great quite range choose gripe place mango lime tasted super artificial mean eating mango lime wing could quite literally feel grain powdered flavour tongue marinade tasted really grainy aside mango lime sauce sauce tried decent overall decent spot
"The Music is Better Than The Food! I've not been to any other branches but this branch is DIRTY!!! I'm referring to customer areas, because of course I did n't inspect the kitchen. Our table was oddly bumpy around the edges too( see pics) the seats were sticky and had all kinds of debris on them. The toilets are dirty too but they do have an accessible toilet on the ground floor which is 1 good thing. Prices do n't represent good value for money but its not overly expensive. The food was hot but between us we tried 5 different wing' flavours' and none of them were special. The lemon pepper was neither particularly lemony or peppery, each BBQ flavour was very similar to the next and all of them were too sweet. Chips were nice. Customer service was awful!

"I have been to this place numerous times with my family. The place is brilliant to dine in. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance here is absolutely fantastic. So why I gave a 2 * rating ? I did an order through the Nando app to deliver food at my home address. I was devastated to see that 9 out of the 10 chicken wings were burned to crispy charcoal level. I could n't believe someone took the pain to pack it and to deliver 9 pieces of chicken charcoal to my home. To top up my agony, when I called their number, the Nando staff disowned me and asked me to call up Deliveroo support to address my concern of unable to eat chicken charcoal pieces. I ca n't believe that for the food I ordered from Nando app I have to call Deliveroo for them to take ownership of the pieces of charcoal that was delivered!

"I went in to Jesters for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon after a quick visit to Dewsbury. What a mistake. At first, I went in and walked back out after assuming it was shut as there was no staff around, and the whole building was empty with no music, etc. I walked around outside and spoke with a mate who said it should be open and went to try again after 20 minutes. There was a staff on the counter who looked grumpy and not welcoming, but I still ordered my burger meal. Whilst waiting, I could hear some staff at the back being loud and noisy playing about, but I just ignored it, and then they started to play music on their phones. There were no other customers until I left, but the tables were not clean. I sat on one table that was slightly clean to eat when my food was ready thinking this Jesters chunky chicken fillet meal would be great but after a few bites I knew this was a mistake, bland flavour, a few slice of shredded lettuce( nothing else) and literally a pinch of burger sauce.

"It's a premier inn what else needs to be said. Hotel was smart, beds so comfortable and rooms accessible for someone with mobility issues this is crucial. What let's it down is the parking. No car park attached, and nearest NCP a good few hundred yards away. For someone with mobility issues this was a real problem.

"I popped into the St Helens branch of Nando while out shopping. I have n't visited this Nando before. Upon entering, the staff were friendly and directed us to a table. It was n't overly busy when we visited. We ordered our food at the counter, and the food arrived within 12 minutes of ordering. The meal I ate was good. A chicken thigh burger with chips and on the cob. The burger was good and tasty. The peri chips were a little bland, I thought, and seemed slightly undercooked. The was nice and juicy.

"A group of 12 of us booked this place for a leaving function, due to some people arriving late there were complications caused by our party. The staff handled everything very well and were extremely accommodating throughout what must have been a frustrating process for them. Eventually we had 2 lanes sorted out and a thoroughly enjoyable time! Car parking is easy with a number of facilities in the area, payment for parking is best through an app we have discovered. It also free after 1600 in the carpark we chose. The bowling centre is located on the second floor of the building, there are stairs available as well as a lift should you need it. Inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks, quite a few arcade games are also available; some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes. The bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to 6 people per lane, we had 2 lanes next to each other for our group. Military discount is available making it around 8 per game, table service from the bar can be achieved by scanning a QR code from the small table at your lane. Based on this experience I would highly recommend this place for some light hearted fun.",1,a group of of us booked this place for a leaving function due to some people arriving late there were complications caused by our party the staff handled everything very well and were extremely accommodating throughout what must have been a frustrating process for them eventually we had lanes sorted out and a thoroughly enjoyable time car parking is easy with a number of facilities in the area payment for parking is best through an app we have discovered it also free after in the carpark we chose the bowling centre is located on the second floor of the building there are stairs available as well as a lift should you need it inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks quite a few arcade games are also available some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes the bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to people per lane we had lanes next to each other for our group military discount is available making it around per game table service from the bar can be achieved by scanning a qr code from the small table at your lane based on this experience i would highly recommend this place for some light hearted fun,group u booked place leaving function due people arriving late complication caused party staff handled everything well extremely accommodating throughout must frustrating process eventually lane sorted thoroughly enjoyable time car parking easy number facility area payment parking best app discovered also free carpark chose bowling centre located second floor building stair available well lift need inside place spacious plenty seating eating food drink quite arcade game also available win ticket exchanged prize bowling well maintained set allowing people per lane lane next group military discount available making around per game table service bar achieved scanning qr code small table lane based experience would highly recommend place light hearted fun

"A nice clean beefeater with pretty speedy service and pleasant staff. I visited while staying at the Premier Inn next door. I had booked online in advance( I recommend you always try to do this as they book up super fast at times), the staff had me seated quickly at a nice clean table. The menu has been recently updated but it is n't very different to the previous one( except the prices which all seem to have increased). I tried the hot crunchy chicken to start which came with a little bit of garnish. The hot sauce is ok but not face meltingly hot. I followed this with the double stack burger with fries. Everything was nicely cooked and served quickly, the serving staff came to my table regularly to make sure everything was ok and were pleasant.

"Card only payment. It was my first visit here. A delightful and busy little cafe close to the Cathedral and Tullie. There's on street disc parking nearby, and with its close proximity to the city centre, there are ample car parks to choose from. There are good public transport links to the city as well. Dogs are allowed. Helpful and friendly staff who were very efficient. A good choice of hot and cold beverages, to sit in or take away. The cups are fabulous. They all have something descriptive written on the bottom. What will yours say ? A wide choice of breakfasts, including vegetarian and vegan. Light meals and sweet treats are available, too. The cafe is split across two levels. The upper level is accessed by stairs. This is where the compact toilet facilities are located. I want to go again to sample more of the menu.

It's a good chicken shop. The only reason I did n't give 5 stars is the fries were a bit on the short side for me.

"Friday night. Nice and busy, a good buzz, but not too noisy. We had booked at 8 for two but one of the main guys moved us from our smallish table for two to a larger corner table. Good start. Service was attentive and friendly throughout. Draft Cobra beer or bottled “ draft ” Effes, both really cold. The rosé wine was crisp, well chilled and not too pink. We had calamari( which was not rubbery) served in a crisp batter to start. We then both had lamb from the grill as a main course-minced Adana Lamb on skewers and Lamb Shish on a hollowed out rolling pin( bit odd!)-the meat was tender and tasty-and both courses came with spiced bulgar wheat-although we did n’t think the chilli dip was chilli hot enough. Then some Baklava which were oozing with sweetness, plus pistachio ice cream-a great end to a very good meal. Would definitely recommend.",1,friday night nice and busy a good buzz but not too noisy we had booked at for two but one of the main guys moved us from our smallish table for two to a larger corner table good start service was attentive and friendly throughout draft cobra beer or bottled draft effes both really cold the ros wine was crisp well chilled and not too pink we had calamari which was not rubbery served in a crisp batter to start we then both had lamb from the grill as a main course minced adana lamb on skewers and lamb shish on a hollowed out rolling pin bit odd the meat was tender and tasty and both courses came with spiced bulgar wheat although we did n t think the chilli dip was chilli hot enough then some baklava which were oozing with sweetness plus pistachio ice cream a great end to a very good meal would definitely recommend,friday night nice busy good buzz not noisy booked two one main guy moved u smallish table two larger corner table good start service attentive friendly throughout draft cobra beer bottled draft effes really cold ro wine crisp well chilled not pink calamari not rubbery served crisp batter start lamb grill main course minced adana lamb skewer lamb shish hollowed rolling pin bit odd meat tender tasty course came spiced bulgar wheat although n t think chilli dip chilli hot enough baklava oozing sweetness plus pistachio ice cream great end good meal would definitely recommend

Sorry I was hungry and forgot to take the pictures of the starters, but I can assure you it was just as nice as the main and dessert. The final verdict is. You do n't always get what you pay for, because sometimes you get that little something special. The restaurant industry needs to survive, but they also know the customers are facing a financial crunch too. They did n't raise the prices to increase revenue. They just added more table and chairs and an extra sitting so that they can work harder and still allow the majority to enjoy this gratifying meal.",1,this place is a treasure for those on a budget it is not fancy but everyone who come in seem to be treated like a regular or close friend we came in for an early bird dinner after securing a time slot of with notice to vacate the table by that is fine as that is plenty of time for a table of two you get to choose from the main menu with dishes labelled with eb by the side courses for and courses for yes that is right it is not a typo sorry i was hungry and forgot to take the pictures of the starters but i can assure you it was just as nice as the main and dessert the final verdict is you do n t always get what you pay for because sometimes you get that little something special the restaurant industry needs to survive but they also know the customers are facing a financial crunch too they did n t raise the prices to increase revenue they just added more table and chairs and an extra sitting so that they can work harder and still allow the majority to enjoy this gratifying meal,place treasure budget not fancy everyone come seem treated like regular close friend came early bird dinner securing time slot notice vacate table fine plenty time table two get choose main menu dish labelled eb side course course yes right not typo sorry hungry forgot take picture starter assure nice main dessert final verdict n t always get pay sometimes get little something special restaurant industry need survive also know customer facing financial crunch n t raise price increase revenue added table chair extra sitting work harder still allow majority enjoy gratifying meal

"I'll start with the positives. Lovely little coffee shop. We booked an afternoon tea for 2 and made the reservation via the contact form, which was nice and easy. Staff were friendly and attentive. Coffee was beautiful, and our sour dough toasties were OMG! I feel like the price was okay for what we had and the service we received. The atmosphere and regulars were lovely, including the little pup visitors. You can tell people love it here! We will definitely be back for the main menu as it looked great. My only criticisms were that the scones were very dry and almost dusty. You cut through them and end up with flour everywhere, from the inside, which was odd for me. We've had afternoon teas before, but from other places at similar cost, and you usually get a small selection of bite size cakes / sweet treats each. This tea had 3 cakes, which we cut in half to share, which were ok. Although full, I felt like it was just lacking something, not so much food wise, but just something i ca n't put my finger on.

Not all customers bin their food leftovers just like in other fast food places, which is a total shame. Anyway, I would totally recommend those fries",1,we were in this branch for lunch on th the fries are delicious however the burger was too oily that my partner and i felt like the meal was too heavy like if chicken is n t cook with extra hot oil in order for it to absorb less oil service is excellent everyone is very polite and they try to keep the area clean not all customers bin their food leftovers just like in other fast food places which is a total shame anyway i would totally recommend those fries,branch lunch th fry delicious however burger oily partner felt like meal heavy like chicken n t cook extra hot oil order absorb less oil service excellent everyone polite try keep area clean not customer bin food leftover like fast food place total shame anyway would totally recommend fry
"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019. The price was also I felt too high, our bill came in at 77, which if it had been more like 50 I would have been perfectly happy.",1,a bit overpriced but still tasty we were a bit cautious coming here on a visit seeing it used to have a michelin star as plastered across the windows but no longer has it however the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course unfortunately this fell a little short for me but no doubt it was still good quality to start we had the soft she will crab and yakitori yakitori were pretty standard on a par with just about every other place we have had it but they are so good as it is the crab on the other hand was excellent delicate flavour and cooked to perfection for mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat it came with rice as well though so probably this was by design however rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward i found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour it was n t marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small we also had the special piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss the eel octopus and suf clam were excellent while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n t have any smoky flavour you would expect given the torched presentation overall it was undoubtedly a good meal but i can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after the price was also i felt too high our bill came in at which if it had been more like i would have been perfectly happy,bit overpriced still tasty bit cautious coming visit seeing used michelin star plastered across window no longer however starter excellent convinced u stay main course unfortunately fell little short no doubt still good quality start soft crab yakitori yakitori pretty standard par every place good crab hand excellent delicate flavour cooked perfection main korean sizzling barbecue came far leaf lettuce wrap meat came rice well though probably design however rice served flat plate bit awkward found meat lacking bit flavour n t marinated accompanying sauce portion bit small also special piece sushi selection somewhat hit miss eel octopus suf clam excellent scallop bit gritty n t smoky flavour would expect given torched presentation overall undoubtedly good meal see michelin star rating conspicuously missing price also felt high bill came like would perfectly happy

Walked into this place for an early family dinner. The place was pretty full at the time we went in but managed to get a table. The service was very efficient. The starters were fairly good. The funghi aranchini was spot on and so was the calamari fritto. The main course were a bit of a let down. The pizza( Fiorentina) tasted like something from a supermarket. The base was not well baked and the ingredients did n’t seem fresh. The dessert( Panna cotta) seemed to follow the main course-tasted like a supermarket version.

"By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over 30 of food for home delivery. It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'. Please note this is not about McDonalds overall; just this specific outlet. I do n't think we'll opt to use it again, but I doubt they care about that anyway.",0,by far the worst mcdonald we have ever experienced we ordered just over of food for home delivery it arrived absolutely stone cold not just cold but like it had been prepared hours ago one of the burgers was outside of the box loose in the bag and so was the bun that was with it the drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed fries are often placed upside down in the bag rarely do you get napkins and you would think they might add straws when you order drinks every item needs to be checked before you drive away raw fries was one of the best experiences i do n t mind waiting but at least cook the food because it is generally food to go it is meant to be convenient and fast not much point being fast if the quality is c and then the customer has to park up take the items back and get them replaced there is no quality control nobody cares about what they are churning out it is fast becoming a joke as a specific restaurant please note this is not about mcdonalds overall just this specific outlet i do n t think we will opt to use it again but i doubt they care about that anyway,far worst mcdonald ever experienced ordered food home delivery arrived absolutely stone cold not cold like prepared hour ago one burger outside box loose bag bun drive thru need experienced believed fry often placed upside bag rarely get napkin would think might add straw order drink every item need checked drive away raw fry one best experience n t mind waiting least cook food generally food go meant convenient fast not much point fast quality c customer park take item back get replaced no quality control nobody care churning fast becoming joke specific restaurant please note not mcdonalds overall specific outlet n t think opt use doubt care anyway

"Very good variety of fitness classes and instructors. There is enough equipment in the gym and classes area to use, and they provide ways to disinfect before every use.

I seen some instructors taking action and making attendees sign a registry to confirm they are booked for the session & fine those who do n’t show up.

"I recently visited Tailors Eating House, a pub located in Cheltenham, United Kingdom, with some friends after a day of activities. Our overall experience was quite pleasant. The staff at the pub were friendly and welcoming, which added to the positive atmosphere of the place. One of the highlights of our visit was the wide variety of beverages available. They had an impressive selection of drinks, from local ales to cocktails and non-alcoholic options. It catered to different tastes, making it a great spot for a group with diverse preferences. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5-star rating is that while the drinks and service were excellent, the food menu was a bit limited, and some of the dishes we ordered were just average. Nonetheless, if you're primarily looking for a place to enjoy a nice drink and good company, Tailors Eating House is a great choice. I would definitely recommend it, and I'm giving it a solid 4-star review.",1,i recently visited tailors eating house a pub located in cheltenham united kingdom with some friends after a day of activities our overall experience was quite pleasant the staff at the pub were friendly and welcoming which added to the positive atmosphere of the place one of the highlights of our visit was the wide variety of beverages available they had an impressive selection of drinks from local ales to cocktails and non alcoholic options it catered to different tastes making it a great spot for a group with diverse preferences the only reason i am not giving it a full star rating is that while the drinks and service were excellent the food menu was a bit limited and some of the dishes we ordered were just average nonetheless if you are primarily looking for a place to enjoy a nice drink and good company tailors eating house is a great choice i would definitely recommend it and i am giving it a solid star review,recently visited tailor eating house pub located cheltenham united kingdom friend day activity overall experience quite pleasant staff pub friendly welcoming added positive atmosphere place one highlight visit wide variety beverage available impressive selection drink local ale cocktail non alcoholic option catered different taste making great spot group diverse preference reason not giving full star rating drink service excellent food menu bit limited dish ordered average nonetheless primarily looking place enjoy nice drink good company tailor eating house great choice would definitely recommend giving solid star review

I been ordering from papa johns for years now and since I moved 7mins away from my previous address I found the service and attitude of male staff on the phone terrible. On this occasion I ordered a pizza over an hour ago and it had n’t arrived. When I called up to find out what happened the guy on the phone said the driver was just leaving and rudely added if ‘ I look out of the window I can see that there is a lot of traffic ’. I said but I ordered over an hour ago and he said just look out of the window. He was so rude it put me completely off ordering again. Their pizzas are not even all that.,0,i been ordering from papa johns for years now and since i moved mins away from my previous address i found the service and attitude of male staff on the phone terrible on this occasion i ordered a pizza over an hour ago and it had n t arrived when i called up to find out what happened the guy on the phone said the driver was just leaving and rudely added if i look out of the window i can see that there is a lot of traffic i said but i ordered over an hour ago and he said just look out of the window he was so rude it put me completely off ordering again their pizzas are not even all that,ordering papa john year since moved min away previous address found service attitude male staff phone terrible occasion ordered pizza hour ago n t arrived called find happened guy phone said driver leaving rudely added look window see lot traffic said ordered hour ago said look window rude put completely ordering pizza not even

"Very cosy and popular place. It was our time visiting here and we were impressed with the food and the interior. It's such a cosy and beautiful venue, it was hard not to enjoy our brunch. It was definitely busy and lively and looked like a very popular spot in central Bath. The food was very good, tasty, good portions and well priced. My one and only complaint with the food was that the bottom burger bun was a bit soggy. Otherwise the burger was great! The only reason the' service' received 4 stars was because we had to chase things up. The drinks order came incompete and so did the food order. The staff were polite enough but it appeared as if some things were forgotten. No biggie, plus the drinks / food came out quickly once we chased them up. The downstairs area is dog-friendly and there were plenty of water bowls around.

"Update: I tried the chicken Teriyaki which was nice. But I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken... it was not Korean fried Chicken! It was bits of thigh meat( bit chewy, should have used breast) in plain batter!

I was n't even offered any condiments / Sriracha etc. Very disappointed... I think it was 5 for 5 small bits of chewy chicken thigh meat in batter.

"A surprising little gem in Blackburn Town centre nr the Town Hall. 2 floors with the art gallery upstairs. On the ground floor there's a large collection of old spinning machines and loom which became even more interesting when the Room Steward began to explain their background and history, especially since he had worked assembling them years ago. There's a small costume section, some stuffed birds, an Egyptian section with a mummy and a mummified head, but the best part, in my opinion obviously, was the art gallery with the biggest collection of donated wood prints by the famous master Japanese Ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige from 19th century, including the Great Wave and Red Fuji.

"What truly impressed me, as someone with a gluten intolerance, was the menu – a staggering 98 % gluten-free! The pork and lemongrass meatballs were perfectly seasoned, offering a burst of savory flavor without being overwhelming. Equally delicious were the chicken summer rolls, accompanied by a peanut sauce that boasted a subtle chili kick, adding depth without scorching the palate. For mains, I opted for the hot and spicy chicken pho. While the spice level did n't quite reach the fiery heights I expected, the broth itself was phenomenal – rich, flavorful, and deeply satisfying. My companion devoured the wok-fried chicken noodles, praising their deliciousness.

Below average lunch for two vegetarians. We ordered the broccoli and cauliflower soup and a side dish of new potatoes with spring onions and mustard. The soup arrived scalding hot-had to leave it for 10 minutes to cool down. Watery consistency and lacking in flavour. Croutons but no bread served for 8! The side dish was n't much better-potatoes just about cooked and again not much flavour.

"The culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken – tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality. And with the added incentive of a 50 % discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt, there's even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight.",1,the culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary from the moment you take your first bite you are enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses let us start with the salted chicken tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful each bite reveals layers of complexity with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken next up is the seafood rice a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood succulent shrimp tender squid and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea every spoonful is a delight with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate and then there is the confit duck a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship the duck is slow cooked to perfection resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich savory flavors the skin is rendered to a crispy perfection providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath but it is not just the individual dishes that shine it is the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right with prices ranging from per dish this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality and with the added incentive of a discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt there is even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight,culinary journey restaurant nothing short extraordinary moment take first bite enveloped symphony flavor captivate sens let u start salted chicken tender piece chicken marinated delicate blend spice salt resulting dish succulent flavorful bite reveals layer complexity seasoning perfectly complementing natural sweetness chicken next seafood rice dish transport shore distant sea bounty fresh seafood succulent shrimp tender squid plump mussel mingle fragrant rice creating harmonious fusion land sea every spoonful delight flavor ocean dancing palate confit duck masterpiece culinary craftsmanship duck slow cooked perfection resulting meat meltingly tender imbued rich savory flavor skin rendered crispy perfection providing perfect contrast luscious meat beneath not individual dish shine meticulous attention detail elevates dining experience new height ingredient carefully sourced expertly prepared ensuring every dish masterpiece right price ranging per dish restaurant offer exceptional value without compromising quality added incentive discount next visit keep receipt even reason indulge culinary delight

"Very convenient location just minutes from Liverpool Lime Street, Liverpool Christmas Market and the city center. Friendly and welcoming staff on reception and in the restaurant. The two lifts were slow, and while the breakfast did taste nice, it was small and was n’t worth the 8. Room was decent size, warm, clean and the bed was comfy. Shower was easy to use, and a good temperature. Enjoyed the two slides of cake available to go with a cup of tea. Only downside for the room was the radiator( or something else) that was making cloud clicking noises all night, making it really hard to sleep. This may well just be a fault of this one room which is why I still rated the hotel positively, but I did need to get some sleep on the train back to London.",1,very convenient location just minutes from liverpool lime street liverpool christmas market and the city center friendly and welcoming staff on reception and in the restaurant the two lifts were slow and while the breakfast did taste nice it was small and was n t worth the room was decent size warm clean and the bed was comfy shower was easy to use and a good temperature enjoyed the two slides of cake available to go with a cup of tea only downside for the room was the radiator or something else that was making cloud clicking noises all night making it really hard to sleep this may well just be a fault of this one room which is why i still rated the hotel positively but i did need to get some sleep on the train back to london,convenient location minute liverpool lime street liverpool christmas market city center friendly welcoming staff reception restaurant two lift slow breakfast taste nice small n t worth room decent size warm clean bed comfy shower easy use good temperature enjoyed two slide cake available go cup tea downside room radiator something else making cloud clicking noise night making really hard sleep may well fault one room still rated hotel positively need get sleep train back london
"Having had burgers and fries in various continents and brands such as McDonalds, Shake Shack, 5Guys, CaliBurger, Triple O and Burger King, I have to say this branch even though smaller, has minimal seats cooks a good burger and especially proper potatoe fries freshly made unlike a competitor with golden arches that consistently serves soggy, warm, over salted, processed fries. You can learn a lot from Burger King with properly cooked meals golden arches. Also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature. As with many mainstream burger chains and franchises I find the burgers not served up to 71c cooking temperature.

"A friend and I visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on Instagram as well as some recommendations. I start with the only positive thing I can remember about this unforgettable experience( for all the wrong reasons), the decor and interior was to a high standard. The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our 27 and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them.",0,a friend and i visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on instagram as well as some recommendations i start with the only positive thing i can remember about this unforgettable experience for all the wrong reasons the decor and interior was to a high standard the food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place the cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request an unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food the whole portion was just one giant blob it made no sense we left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything other than the chips the service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately or tables so the service was very slow indeed while i had nice things to say about the decor the temperature inside was comparable to the outside we visited late feb as the ac was blasting out cold air constantly we begrudgingly paid our and left to find another place to eat the google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what i had i can not agree with them,friend visited seeing review picture instagram well recommendation start positive thing remember unforgettable experience wrong reason decor interior high standard food fell extremely short expectation heard good thing place cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like fermenting week warmed upon request unappetising concoction congealed inedible food whole portion one giant blob made no sense left still feeling hungry barely touched anything chip service left lot desired seemed two young girl left tend approximately table service slow indeed nice thing say decor temperature inside comparable outside visited late feb ac blasting cold air constantly begrudgingly paid left find another place eat google review social medium post positive thing say unfortunately visit not agree

"Downtown Thai restaurant with authentic flavours, offering the tapas set menu at lunchtime. For those not quite used to Thai spices, it can not go wrong with the salt and pepper tapas set. It includes fried calamari, amazingly flavourful chicken wings, chicken curry and rice. The Thai milk tea is also authentic. There's also a green papaya salad with the same flavour as the streets of Thailand. The service is pretty good, but the food is served very slowly, almost a 20-30 minute wait at lunchtime. A tip of 10 % or 12 % is automatically added to the bill, although they state that it is discretionary, it is hard to say no in this case.",1,downtown thai restaurant with authentic flavours offering the tapas set menu at lunchtime for those not quite used to thai spices it can not go wrong with the salt and pepper tapas set it includes fried calamari amazingly flavourful chicken wings chicken curry and rice the thai milk tea is also authentic there is also a green papaya salad with the same flavour as the streets of thailand the service is pretty good but the food is served very slowly almost a minute wait at lunchtime a tip of or is automatically added to the bill although they state that it is discretionary it is hard to say no in this case,downtown thai restaurant authentic flavour offering tapa set menu lunchtime not quite used thai spice not go wrong salt pepper tapa set includes fried calamari amazingly flavourful chicken wing chicken curry rice thai milk tea also authentic also green papaya salad flavour street thailand service pretty good food served slowly almost minute wait lunchtime tip automatically added bill although state discretionary hard say no case
"I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread, featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri-salted chips and chili cheese bites. The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates. I enthusiastically recommend Amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence.",1,i ordered takeout from amigos and savored their exquisite spread featuring the renowned boss burger alongside peri salted chips and chili cheese bites the boss burger was a culinary delight boasting succulent perfectly cooked medium rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite though i usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche amigos choice did n t detract from the overall gastronomic experience the peri peri salted chips were executed flawlessly retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess moving on to the chili cheese bites despite a slightly elevated saltiness they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors however the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the reese pieces milkshake this decadent treat boasted a creamy texture elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter chocolate and premium quality ice cream each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression in conclusion my takeaway experience from amigos a halal establishment was exceptional every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates i enthusiastically recommend amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence,ordered takeout amigo savored exquisite spread featuring renowned bos burger alongside peri salted chip chili cheese bite bos burger culinary delight boasting succulent perfectly cooked medium rare meat complemented harmonious blend fried egg turkey strip imparting delightful smoky essence every bite though usually prefer seeded bun sweeter brioche amigo choice n t detract overall gastronomic experience peri peri salted chip executed flawlessly retaining crispiness infused flavorful seasoning avoided hint sogginess moving chili cheese bite despite slightly elevated saltiness outshone counterpart found elsewhere delightfully gooey melted cheese offering satisfying contrast texture flavor however highlight culinary journey undoubtedly reese piece milkshake decadent treat boasted creamy texture elevated perfect fusion peanut butter chocolate premium quality ice cream sip offered symphony flavor tantalized taste bud left lasting impression conclusion takeaway experience amigo halal establishment exceptional every element meticulously crafted delight even discerning palate enthusiastically recommend amigo gourmet burger enthusiast seeking unforgettable indulgence

"So i was looking forward to late lunch from this place, as I had not eaten all day. I ordered a double grill beef burger and loaded fries individually, and the total came up to over 15. I thought this should be good and tasty based on the reviews. I requested the fries to be cooked crispy, as, let's be honest, most fast food establishments fail at this mere task. So my food arrives, and on first impressions, chips were soggy and not crispy as requested and tasted very salty. The burger again, nothing special size of patty to bun ration just did n't make sense. Taste was was ok nothing special.

"Came for a cocktail, a pint and some nibbles with my partner. Drinks: We each got the same cocktail, the Pop Tart. I know that some cocktails are short, but this one was REALLY short. In the picture attached, you can see the tiny glasses with the single massive ice cube each in them. Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff / service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do! But, as a hospitality worker myself, a bit too pricey to be worth it for a long stay, considering the products.

"The drinks we had( cocktails) were more expensive compared to other places by about 2 on average. Which adds up very quickly. The set menu for lunch was really tasty, but most of the options have an additional charge, which makes you wonder why they bother with the set price so low, increase it slightly and makes the food choices standard. My friend who accompanied me was vegan and she also only had 1 option for her food choices, and the only vegan dessert had an extra charge as well, which I thought was unfair. The waitress did offer extra of something as my friend did n't like something on the only main meal option though, which I thought was nice. Overall though we all had a really lovely time.

"This place is n't huge, but my 3 year old nephew had a ball! There's a good few areas of hands on stuff to do, an interactive pond on the floor, instruments, a play area with a slide and tunnel( my nephew favourite) and of course, you get to meet Peter Rabbit. The Peter Rabbit meet was quite short, but little ones only have a small attention span anyway We paid 9 for my nephew and 2 adults with the mid week discount, so really worth it.

"Came here at 7 pm on a Friday night and it was empty. What ever happened to Fish Fridays ? Above all the plaques, newspaper cuttings and famous signatures, I found myself most surprised by the prices that could compete with London. The batter of the fish is thin, golden and crispy; the best type. I ordered a regular and I did n't find myself getting tired of the chips, which never happens. Tasty. The salad went very well with the beige event, especially the red onion. Nice, fresh and 7. Now we are surpassing London prices. All-in-all a charming spot, but a star dropped when factoring in the hefty price for fish and chips( 20 pp).",1,came here at pm on a friday night and it was empty what ever happened to fish fridays above all the plaques newspaper cuttings and famous signatures i found myself most surprised by the prices that could compete with london the batter of the fish is thin golden and crispy the best type i ordered a regular and i did n t find myself getting tired of the chips which never happens tasty the salad went very well with the beige event especially the red onion nice fresh and now we are surpassing london prices all in all a charming spot but a star dropped when factoring in the hefty price for fish and chips pp,came pm friday night empty ever happened fish friday plaque newspaper cutting famous signature found surprised price could compete london batter fish thin golden crispy best type ordered regular n t find getting tired chip never happens tasty salad went well beige event especially red onion nice fresh surpassing london price charming spot star dropped factoring hefty price fish chip pp

Nice concept where you can order from many different vendors via the qr code on your table. The cocktails from the main bar were brilliant and the food from Junk was lovely( it was just a bit cold though) the honeycomb ice cream sundae from Soft Core was perfect and had plenty of caramel sauce. Only feedback would be that it could be a bit cleaner. There were many food runners but I did n't see anyone properly cleaning tables or the ground except to pick up drinks cups.,1,nice concept where you can order from many different vendors via the qr code on your table the cocktails from the main bar were brilliant and the food from junk was lovely it was just a bit cold though the honeycomb ice cream sundae from soft core was perfect and had plenty of caramel sauce only feedback would be that it could be a bit cleaner there were many food runners but i did n t see anyone properly cleaning tables or the ground except to pick up drinks cups,nice concept order many different vendor via qr code table cocktail main bar brilliant food junk lovely bit cold though honeycomb ice cream sundae soft core perfect plenty caramel sauce feedback would could bit cleaner many food runner n t see anyone properly cleaning table ground except pick drink cup
"As someone who leaves honest and gleeful reviews because I know they help people decision and people businesses, this was imperative because of your dishonest reply about this meal. I was truly expecting to be wowed because of the great reviews. I do n’t know if it was the chef on duty or if everyone was tired and did n’t care about the customers but the experience was nothing to write home about. Atmosphere The interior is picturesque and has great lighting but when we got in, there were still used plates on a table or two. The table beside us was sprayed with cleaning agent and was just left there it began to sting my eyes. Had to remind our host to please wipe off what he sprayed on it. Food The starter was just ok. The skewers were n’t well seasoned and I made mention of it. The linguine pasta was cold and so oily. There were no sauces or dips at all and when i asked for chilli I was served mild sriracha sauce swimming in oil The food was so greasy I used up our serviettes wiping oil off my mouth. My husband asked for tomato sauce and was served ketchup Had to force our way through it because we were very hungry. I told the host I did n’t enjoy it. We wanted to order desserts and asked for the menu infact but the main was so bad, we called it a wrap there. Other The menu is very limited. We noticed at least two customers walk in, scan the menu and walk out. An older couple who came in sat for almost 10 minutes before they were attended to. I was almost going to take their order because they just sat there. They left without dining.

"We went to see the Divine Beauty experience at the Cathedral tonight and had a very pleasant experience. There was a technical problem that delayed our entrance, resulting in a 40 minute wait but it seemed to go quickly. I could have done without the drop in temperature though. The' show' comprises of projected Christian images onto the walls and ceiling, with a specially composed soundtrack. I actually enjoyed the music as much, or possibly more than the images. It lasted around 15 mins and the room was not over crowded so all had a good view. The imagery felt a bit random despite the theme, and some of it was abstract. I think it would have been more powerful if it had told a story. Strangely I thought the setting was a distraction but that's probably just me. The show was enjoyable and very competitively pricef but I am not sure if it's something that you would see more than once.",1,we went to see the divine beauty experience at the cathedral tonight and had a very pleasant experience there was a technical problem that delayed our entrance resulting in a minute wait but it seemed to go quickly i could have done without the drop in temperature though the show comprises of projected christian images onto the walls and ceiling with a specially composed soundtrack i actually enjoyed the music as much or possibly more than the images it lasted around mins and the room was not over crowded so all had a good view the imagery felt a bit random despite the theme and some of it was abstract i think it would have been more powerful if it had told a story strangely i thought the setting was a distraction but that is probably just me the show was enjoyable and very competitively pricef but i am not sure if it is something that you would see more than once,went see divine beauty experience cathedral tonight pleasant experience technical problem delayed entrance resulting minute wait seemed go quickly could done without drop temperature though show comprises projected christian image onto wall ceiling specially composed soundtrack actually enjoyed music much possibly image lasted around min room not crowded good view imagery felt bit random despite theme abstract think would powerful told story strangely thought setting distraction probably show enjoyable competitively pricef not sure something would see

"All meats were severely overcooked. Requested 2 steaks, one medium rare and one rare, both were criminally well done and bone dry. All chicken was also dry and overcooked. The “ barbecued ” chicken was in fact boiled and was very obvious. All the food came in no specific order( Mains before Starters, dishes missing components) and even some dishes not arriving at all. The service was not adequate, the waiter spilt an entire glass of some sort of fizzy drink on one of us, and only said ‘ sorry bro ’ and wiped it off with a lack of effort. The restaurant was way too crowded and very very noisy. The Manager gave us 20 off of the bill, but that was NOT an acceptable mean, realistically we should not have even paid.

We were pretty much the first ones there and my friend was reminded within five minutes of sitting that we only had the table for two hours so to order soon. Not a great start. The waiter we had on the bar was not friendly and came across condescending when explaining I was n’t ordering enough( we had n’t been told about the small plates before that). 14-25 per small plate and being expected to order about 5-6 between you felt a lot based on the service too. Our waiter would n’t leave us alone and we got urged to order about three times before we finally did. We probably would stayed longer( we only stayed just over an hour) and had more food if it was n’t for the rushed feeling. Nothing was labelled on the chalkboard as vegetarian or if there were allergies present. Even after speaking to the waiter, I was a little confused.

"Found this place on timeout and went for Sunday roasts. The food tasted standard. Half of the plate was filled with cabbage and not enough of other vegetables. The price came to 28 per person, which was quite expensive for the location, food and service we received. We had a reservation but was made to sit next to the door in December, when we had asked to sit somewhere else and was refused, despite other tables being free during our whole visit. The restaurant was very unorganised, 20 used glasses were left on the bar table. We tried to pay in cash, and the restaurant did n’t even have in change, so we had to pay with card. Would not revisit again.",0,found this place on timeout and went for sunday roasts the food tasted standard half of the plate was filled with cabbage and not enough of other vegetables the price came to per person which was quite expensive for the location food and service we received we had a reservation but was made to sit next to the door in december when we had asked to sit somewhere else and was refused despite other tables being free during our whole visit the restaurant was very unorganised used glasses were left on the bar table we tried to pay in cash and the restaurant did n t even have in change so we had to pay with card would not revisit again,found place timeout went sunday roast food tasted standard half plate filled cabbage not enough vegetable price came per person quite expensive location food service received reservation made sit next door december asked sit somewhere else refused despite table free whole visit restaurant unorganised used glass left bar table tried pay cash restaurant n t even change pay card would not revisit

"I do n't think the lady who greeted us understood we had booked. I kept saying we have booked. She kept saying table for two. She put us on a table right next to the toilet away from others, up a step and away from the nicely set tables. Our table had any old serviettes where other empty tables were red and beautifully folded. There were filthy windows at the back of restaurant to one side of us. Huge cobwebs hung at the side of fireplace where a skirting board held it up along with cobwebs between a Christmas tree and storm lamp on the fireplace-it is now May! There were Christmas lights on the logs in the fire well. The fireplace itself looks like it came out of a local dumpit site. This place did not have any of the drinks I chose-medication stops me having alcohol, so I had to have water. My caprese salad came without balsamic vinegar so I got up to ask for it. The lasagne was 2 inches square-the smallest I've ever seen!!! It was swimming in tomato sauce. The penne dish went cold quickly and was soon dried up. When the food arrived the waiter shouted at us not spoke, then thanked us in GERMAN ? ? ? We are Yorkshire through and through. We had to get up again to ask for desert menu and chose one but could we have two spoons please. The waitress forgot what we wanted so came back. When we went to the bar to pay, the bill was not ready. Some tables were still not occupied when we had finished. We were glad to leave.",0,i do n t think the lady who greeted us understood we had booked i kept saying we have booked she kept saying table for two she put us on a table right next to the toilet away from others up a step and away from the nicely set tables our table had any old serviettes where other empty tables were red and beautifully folded there were filthy windows at the back of restaurant to one side of us huge cobwebs hung at the side of fireplace where a skirting board held it up along with cobwebs between a christmas tree and storm lamp on the fireplace it is now may there were christmas lights on the logs in the fire well the fireplace itself looks like it came out of a local dumpit site this place did not have any of the drinks i chose medication stops me having alcohol so i had to have water my caprese salad came without balsamic vinegar so i got up to ask for it the lasagne was inches square the smallest i have ever seen it was swimming in tomato sauce the penne dish went cold quickly and was soon dried up when the food arrived the waiter shouted at us not spoke then thanked us in german we are yorkshire through and through we had to get up again to ask for desert menu and chose one but could we have two spoons please the waitress forgot what we wanted so came back when we went to the bar to pay the bill was not ready some tables were still not occupied when we had finished we were glad to leave,n t think lady greeted u understood booked kept saying booked kept saying table two put u table right next toilet away others step away nicely set table table old serviette empty table red beautifully folded filthy window back restaurant one side u huge cobweb hung side fireplace skirting board held along cobweb christmas tree storm lamp fireplace may christmas light log fire well fireplace look like came local dumpit site place not drink chose medication stop alcohol water caprese salad came without balsamic vinegar got ask lasagne inch square smallest ever seen swimming tomato sauce penne dish went cold quickly soon dried food arrived waiter shouted u not spoke thanked u german yorkshire get ask desert menu chose one could two spoon please waitress forgot wanted came back went bar pay bill not ready table still not occupied finished glad leave

Food is reasonable, Chicken Biryani and Beef Nihari were of good taste and the portion size was decent too, but they serve in open pots with no lid so food gets cold quickly. Also, not sure it they use too much turmeric in biryani or it was some cheap food colour that left pretty stubborn yellow stains on my fingers and nails( I eat using my hand following Sunnah). They have a sign on till saying they take cash only, but you can do bank transfer to them as well. They have floor sitting I think for families as they have curtains but they are useless being see through and across the tables, so it is an awkward view especially with family if you using floor seating and people sitting on chair oppsite to you side stare at you directly due to the position of seatings.",0,restaurant needs a bit more lighting re paint to be something vibrant and not dull grey ambience feels very dull and boring food is reasonable chicken biryani and beef nihari were of good taste and the portion size was decent too but they serve in open pots with no lid so food gets cold quickly also not sure it they use too much turmeric in biryani or it was some cheap food colour that left pretty stubborn yellow stains on my fingers and nails i eat using my hand following sunnah they have a sign on till saying they take cash only but you can do bank transfer to them as well they have floor sitting i think for families as they have curtains but they are useless being see through and across the tables so it is an awkward view especially with family if you using floor seating and people sitting on chair oppsite to you side stare at you directly due to the position of seatings,restaurant need bit lighting paint something vibrant not dull grey ambience feel dull boring food reasonable chicken biryani beef nihari good taste portion size decent serve open pot no lid food get cold quickly also not sure use much turmeric biryani cheap food colour left pretty stubborn yellow stain finger nail eat using hand following sunnah sign till saying take cash bank transfer well floor sitting think family curtain useless see across table awkward view especially family using floor seating people sitting chair oppsite side stare directly due position seating

"Excellent experience at Da Mario! When I first walk into the restaurant, I can smell the flavour of Italian from the surroundings. The service is, one of the waiter is very nice to us, he serviced us instantly and bring whatever we want. However, while we sat for our booked table with just 3 min, we are asked to switch table and gave the table to a group of people who do n’t have reservations. The pastas are amazing. I love them so much, one is creamy and rich, another one is fresh and delicious. However, the salad and pizza is slightly disappointed. It was n’t bad at all but it just nothing special especially comparing to the pasta. The price is very decent. Four of us for 4 dishes only cost each of us 17 pounds per person.

"I went to Pulteney Bridge in Bath, and it was amazing! The bridge looks really special because it has shops built right on it, which is pretty unique. Walking across the bridge was really fun because I could stop and look at all the shops. They had everything from cute little boutiques to cozy cafes. The best part was the view of the river. It was so pretty, especially with the old buildings reflected in the water. I took lots of pictures! One thing to note is that it can get busy, especially on weekends when lots of people visit. But even with the crowds, it's still a really cool place to see. I'd definitely recommend checking out Pulteney Bridge if you're in Bath.

The staff were the highlight of this place. I was part of a large group of 7 or 8 and our orders were taken accurately and efficiently. We were n't made to feel like an inconvenience. The ribs were tender but they did taste pre cooked. Overall the food was better than the usual pub food but was still pub food if that makes sense.,1,the staff were the highlight of this place i was part of a large group of or and our orders were taken accurately and efficiently we were n t made to feel like an inconvenience the ribs were tender but they did taste pre cooked overall the food was better than the usual pub food but was still pub food if that makes sense,staff highlight place part large group order taken accurately efficiently n t made feel like inconvenience rib tender taste pre cooked overall food better usual pub food still pub food make sense

"It is a great live music venture that offers so much to emerging artists and people who want to get into the music industry. With a small bar at the front, you can then either enter the main venue hall( seats around 200) behind the bar, with a large seated area to eat and drink to the right. There is also an outside area. We went for the launch of a new magazine. The complimentary food of haloumi fries, fried cauliflower and salt and pepper fries were all OK, but nothing special.

"First time trying Uyghur food, overall very delicious mains and great value for money. Lambtugur dumplings: delicious, dough is thicker than other Asian dumplings I had, almost similar to a pelmeni. The meat is well seasoned and goes well with the vinegary chilli oil Diced Leghmen: was intrigued by the idea of diced noodles and it definitely delivered. There was a great crunch from the veg, the sauce was spicy, numbing and a little funky which was delicious. Kept having more! Etles spicy trotters: the sauce on this is truly exceptional, I personally love the texture of trotters so I really enjoyed this dish, maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n’t like the texture( but still loved the sauce). Honey cake: dense and oddly cold, was n’t the best honey cake I had. If I were to come to Etles again I stick to the mains!

"Rooms adequately clean( though corners of bathroom were left out; I AM fussy though). Beds were comfy. Quiet room. Room too hot. On the morning of we all had breakfast which was tasty. The lady running it seemed super stressed and rushed off her feet which I am sympathetic about. However her stress made me stressed. She was short with customers, quickly rattled off choices, sighed and tutted, just pointed quickly when asked where something was and was actually abit brutal to a young male waiter who possibly had less experience, but certainly had a better attitude. Sorry, but for me a pleasant manner is so important. I have been a waitress myself back in the day and despite being super stressed and busy know that a smile can make a real difference to someone experience.

"We recently booked a 50th party here for a large group of 20 people. The management team was extremely accommodating of our needs and allowed me time to set up the tables and area of dining how I wished. Provided me with an extra table for the cake. We pre ordered our food, which made the evening run amazingly, and the bill was paid before the guests arrived. It's definitely an easier way to do it. The staff who served us were also extremely efficient, and food came out at great speed when needed. The manageress attended to us so well even when there was a small issue with a meal. I personally spoke to her at the end of the evening and gave my personal feedback, which she took on board. I would point out that the One star review awared by another guest, my father, was unjustified and not a true reflection of the whole night. We will come back to this restaurant as its now our 3rd or 4th visit. Yes, some improvements are needed, which I again addressed, and I hope they are sorted out.

"The Old Manor is the oldest Wetherspoons opened outside of London-way back in 1993. Overlooked by many visitors to the town centre, now the Lexicon Centre has opened. However, a short walk away is reasonably priced food and drink in Bracknell, it is well worth a visit. Have visited here many times over the years. If real ales are your tipple, worth checking the app. As the range that is on is usually spread between both the main and side bars. Usually pop in for Breakfast if I'm in the area-which can be had for a reasonable. Update. Popped in for the fabled Turkey Dinner-the nearest you will to a roast dinner at and a pint of Green Jack Lurcher stout. It would be great if Wetherspoons started doing roast dinners once again.

"Alright, I have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding Superbowl in Barnsley but in fairness I think some are a little harsh to say the least. The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex. Further to this, it our little girl enjoyed it so much that she cried when she left so it is appealing to kids.",1,alright i have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding superbowl in barnsley but in fairness i think some are a little harsh to say the least the superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry for those that like to take the staircase there steps too once you get inside of the room where the superbowl bowling arcade and crazy club play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside including the noises of the machines they also had some good music playing whilst people bowled have to say personally i love the look and feel of the place this place is going to be popular with families kids and teens through the holidays my daughter who is years old played inside the crazy club play area for hours straight albeit we initially attended at am it turns out barnsley super bowl does n t open until am on weekdays now and google or their website has n t been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go i would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the internet the play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n t the largest play area and on a weekends i was told it gets super busy so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until am when we went the entire place is pretty good the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages you can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price there are plenty of toilets at the location and i have to say anyone i saw inside superbowl barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face i try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a ghostbusters teddy and did n t managed to win one ha maybe next time i have attached some pictures of our day at the complex further to this it our little girl enjoyed it so much that she cried when she left so it is appealing to kids,alright seen negative positive review regarding superbowl barnsley fairness think little harsh say least superbowl second floor within complex great wheel chair access via two lift upon entry like take staircase step get inside room superbowl bowling arcade crazy club play area met large room reminds walking arcade seaside including noise machine also good music playing whilst people bowled say personally love look feel place place going popular family kid teen holiday daughter year old played inside crazy club play area hour straight albeit initially attended turn barnsley super bowl n t open weekday google website n t updated reflect make sure check opening time go would suggest calling information reflected internet play area adequate size beware n t largest play area weekend told get super busy weekday best almost empty went entire place pretty good food alright nothing special staff lovely personable hopefully get better place age get food soft drink play area main room honesty reasonable price plenty toilet location say anyone saw inside superbowl barnsley appeared smile face try luck one grabber win ghostbusters teddy n t managed win one ha maybe next time attached picture day complex little girl enjoyed much cried left appealing kid

"Their' lunchbox' choices and'' fried noodles are the best bargain you can find anywhere around Sale. I love their nasi goreng( Indonesian or Malaysian fried rice) and the available choice of pad thai sauce for the'' plate is another appeal for me.

"Words ca n't describe how well looked after I felt and how safe I felt. Nothing too big or too small for reception staff. There might be a little wait and not always someone at the desk but I ca n't fault them. They do n't seem to assume regarding calling anyone sir or madam, they seem to have actually had training regarding this. A staff member referred to me as she / her( I identify as non-binary and my pronouns are they them their, my title is Mx) but I respect that in this day and age we are still brought up that way, I politely corrected her and she was genuinely apologetic about it I assured her it was OK. No offence was taken.:-) There is a little wait for room service such as food but they always remember and the attitude and manners are amazing, they do their best to have a bit of chit chat. They were great interacting with my pooch. And the bed they provided, I want it! And the little doggy bag gifts and treats made me emotional because it was so thoughtful! And generous! The standard double I had at first the temperature controls I think froze but they kindly helped me move rooms where they worked helping me carry my belongings. I ca n't thank everyone enough for being so kind with me, polite, friendly, helpful, caring and welcoming. Top quality service. There's the occasional weird loud sound from the staff lift on 3rd floor but it rarely happens.

"Comfy and relaxing coffee shop right in the centre of Woolwich in general Gordon Square. The coffee is delicious, with a nice selection of other drinks, pastries, treats, sandwiches. One of the reasons I continue returning here is the accessible location and super comfortable leather seating, and huge windows where you can people watch to your hearts content. The staff in here are friendly and I am always greeted with a smile. The vibe is chilled with green walls on the interior, wooden tables, framed images and a section on the wall with clocks set to main cities around the world. The place is kept very clean, so you wo n't see tables with used coffee cups lying around. There is also an outside seating area where the train station, DLR, bus stops and taxi rank are all in sight along with the main square which is surrounded by all kinds of shops including a big Tesco Extra, bars, hair salons, ice cream shops etc. Definitely worth a visit. # woolwich # coffee # visitwoolwich # southeastlondon",1,comfy and relaxing coffee shop right in the centre of woolwich in general gordon square the coffee is delicious with a nice selection of other drinks pastries treats sandwiches one of the reasons i continue returning here is the accessible location and super comfortable leather seating and huge windows where you can people watch to your hearts content the staff in here are friendly and i am always greeted with a smile the vibe is chilled with green walls on the interior wooden tables framed images and a section on the wall with clocks set to main cities around the world the place is kept very clean so you wo n t see tables with used coffee cups lying around there is also an outside seating area where the train station dlr bus stops and taxi rank are all in sight along with the main square which is surrounded by all kinds of shops including a big tesco extra bars hair salons ice cream shops etc definitely worth a visit woolwich coffee visitwoolwich southeastlondon,comfy relaxing coffee shop right centre woolwich general gordon square coffee delicious nice selection drink pastry treat sandwich one reason continue returning accessible location super comfortable leather seating huge window people watch heart content staff friendly always greeted smile vibe chilled green wall interior wooden table framed image section wall clock set main city around world place kept clean wo n t see table used coffee cup lying around also outside seating area train station dlr bus stop taxi rank sight along main square surrounded kind shop including big tesco extra bar hair salon ice cream shop etc definitely worth visit woolwich coffee visitwoolwich southeastlondon

"Popped into this place for a meal( lunch). Found the app too annoying to use so I ordered the old school way( at the bar). Plenty of spaces if you like spacious fine dining. I opted to sit near the escape doors at the back of the venue as the last time I was in the same venue it got pretty ugly, and although this time my visit was during the day, I opted for safety over risk. Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary. The back is quite pleasing on the eye. I can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer. Best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving.

"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.",0,i visited the odeon on new street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area i imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure to start there is n t really anywhere that close that is reliably available for disabled people some street parking is n t far away but it is a gamble if you are going for that route and tight on time for your movie the cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the odeon sign obscured the entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem i say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently i do n t know if you can make it down to that area without assistance the biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay one drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as i said i could n t try myself to see if you can use them without aid the disabled toilet was disgusting it did n t look like it had been cleaned all weekend this was at pm sunday and was quite small so not much room to maneuver if you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you i can imagine it would be very troublesome then i made my way to screen which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan a rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side the issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen because of this i nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door the quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean personally however i would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially it would be a case of needs must for me to visit again,visited odeon new street first possibly last time depending film availability area imagine experience completely different able bodied perspective wheelchair user challenge sure start n t really anywhere close reliably available disabled people street parking n t far away gamble going route tight time movie cinema outside easily mistaken coffee shop scaffolding place currently odeon sign obscured entrance fine two set stair screen film showing posed small problem say small without much chance see lift provided could used independently n t know make area without assistance biggest positive came staff helpful operated lift occasion without fuss delay one drawback fit one chair user time said could n t try see use without aid disabled toilet disgusting n t look like cleaned weekend pm sunday quite small not much room maneuver somebody needed carer inside imagine would troublesome made way screen website looked magnificent seating plan rare reserved area back middle park ideal unlike usual option front row one side issue came opening door slope leading screen nearly ended chair several time foot slipped chair due leaning forward open try get door quality screen fine everything outside toilet clean personally however would not recommend cinema anyone else mobility issue especially would case need must visit
"Took my nippers there as an arranged half term thing. I was very much looking forward to it with the promise of a huge selection of retro games on offer and the kids were keen to try out the vr and ps5 etc. It was very quiet when we arrived. With us( 4) there were probably only another 3 kids there. The retro games were on 2 arcade machines. They were tiny though. A modern arcade machine not like the ones in the arcadea when I was young. I'm sure these ones use a lot less power but when 2 people try to play at the same time, you really are squished in close and generally it's hard to play. Some. A good selection of Street Fighter games( sonic boom!) and some other games. I was. Very happy to see joust on one of the machines. Love that game and wasted a lot of my youth playing that. The kids played on the Nintendo Wii but there was no vr to be seen. Maybe it's hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it. The kids fired up the Xbox but it only had 1 controller so they could n't play together which was a shame. A huge selection of board games were available which was ace too. A nice place to hang out and hopefully it'll be supported by the locals.",1,took my nippers there as an arranged half term thing i was very much looking forward to it with the promise of a huge selection of retro games on offer and the kids were keen to try out the vr and ps etc it was very quiet when we arrived with us there were probably only another kids there the retro games were on arcade machines they were tiny though a modern arcade machine not like the ones in the arcadea when i was young i am sure these ones use a lot less power but when people try to play at the same time you really are squished in close and generally it is hard to play some a good selection of street fighter games sonic boom and some other games i was very happy to see joust on one of the machines love that game and wasted a lot of my youth playing that the kids played on the nintendo wii but there was no vr to be seen maybe it is hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it the kids fired up the xbox but it only had controller so they could n t play together which was a shame a huge selection of board games were available which was ace too a nice place to hang out and hopefully it will be supported by the locals,took nipper arranged half term thing much looking forward promise huge selection retro game offer kid keen try vr p etc quiet arrived u probably another kid retro game arcade machine tiny though modern arcade machine not like one arcadea young sure one use lot less power people try play time really squished close generally hard play good selection street fighter game sonic boom game happy see joust one machine love game wasted lot youth playing kid played nintendo wii no vr seen maybe hidden sight ask kid fired xbox controller could n t play together shame huge selection board game available ace nice place hang hopefully supported local

"I stayed there recently and did n’t see a staff member during my visit. The room was good and comfortable. In the morning I used the shower and folded down the shower seat which was covered in mildew or similar. It clearly had been wet from previous guests and not been dried to cleaned by housekeeping. I also phoned a day after checkout as I thought I left my phone charger. I was able to speak to one person who said they check lost property and phone me back. That was around 10 days ago and heard nothing. Tried to call multiple times but never able to speak to someone and an automated message says staff are busy, call later.

We tried this Italian restaurant in Ruislip for a late brunch and were impressed with their two course early bird menu which is very good value at 14 per person and delivers in terms of food quality. I went for the parmigiana to start which was well balanced and simply scrumptious. For my main I tried the rigatoni alla boscailo which was a mushroom pasta with a gorgonzola and cream sauce. Vegetarian pasta frequently disappoints especially when on a set menu but this certainly did not. You will find great service in Mamma Rosa and it is so nice to find a decent Italian restaurant a stone throw from home.,1,we tried this italian restaurant in ruislip for a late brunch and were impressed with their two course early bird menu which is very good value at per person and delivers in terms of food quality i went for the parmigiana to start which was well balanced and simply scrumptious for my main i tried the rigatoni alla boscailo which was a mushroom pasta with a gorgonzola and cream sauce vegetarian pasta frequently disappoints especially when on a set menu but this certainly did not you will find great service in mamma rosa and it is so nice to find a decent italian restaurant a stone throw from home,tried italian restaurant ruislip late brunch impressed two course early bird menu good value per person delivers term food quality went parmigiana start well balanced simply scrumptious main tried rigatoni alla boscailo mushroom pasta gorgonzola cream sauce vegetarian pasta frequently disappoints especially set menu certainly not find great service mamma rosa nice find decent italian restaurant stone throw home
"This is a nice restaurant with a good really classy cosy decor inside. The food on the whole is very good. The duck salad is delicious, calamari is nice but nothing extraordinary. The duck curry is tasty and good flavour, only thing is rice portion is very small. The steak is very nice and good quality of meat and cooked well. The chips are nice too. The service is really excellent and friendly. Drinks are probably good but I sadly did not like the cocktail I ordered( polar bear ice blue one). Overall really lovely meal and restaurant and would definitely recommend. If you are going to the Ivy you likely know the way it works and sort of thing on menu. It expected that chips / sides come separate and menu is not that big / unique. That is just the ivy.

"Lovely wetherspoons. Ca n't really tell its true size till you're inside, but it is very spacious. It has multiple floors, plenty of space for small and larger grous alike. It has plenty of character and plenty on the walls if you like the wetherspoons facts / area histories. Food was served pretty quickly, although it was quite empty when i ordered. It did get quite packed after, so i go lucky with timing. Staff were all friendly and checked my meal was all good, and that it was. Nothing missing from my order, and the same great prices wetherspoons are known for.

"First visit here in years-still got it. Located bang in the middle of Upper Street Angel North London. Despite it being in the middle of winter, we still fancied something cold and sweet. There was such a good variety of flavours, from birthday cake to pistachio to mango sorbet to their monthly special, cinnamon roll. Love that it's all clearly labelled, and that there's vegan flavours too. As I was the only person in the queue, staff really took her time with me, explaining the flavours and allowing me to taste them too. We ended going for two regular scoops(), the pistachio and oreo chocolate cheesecake which was also her favourite too. We also ordered two smaller scoops() of the birthday cake and chocolate, you ca n't go wrong with this really, can you ? Also an Americano, which we added some of the ice cream in, new twist. Great that you have the option of scoop size. There were also options for toppings too. Tasted fresh with amazing flavours, creamy and rich but not too sweet either, just right. Small seating area with a cute swing seat. Roughly seats 10-12 in total. Note, there is no toilet available. Will be returning again.

Hubby is dairy intolerant and their allergen menu is accessible through a qr code. You tap in what your are allergic to and it hides menu items that are off the list. He was quite impressed with this. Unfortunately had to drop a star for food this time. I ordered buttermilk fried chicken it was huge( see pic) and had a weird curry taste. Now wondering if actually they served me the wrong thing. Two flat coated breasts arrived, I took one home for the dog and the paper towel in the box was stained yellow!

Popped here for a quick lunch. It located in the business park so handy before cinema or golf. My daughter and I both had the same dish so ca n’t show you many photos. We were welcomed by a friendly woman. They did ask about allergies which was nice. My daughter and I both had the linguine carbonara. It was decent. It a large portion for anyone less than a teenager. Food came out in a reasonable time frame. Was well cooked. The balance of the dish not quite as good as some other places. But sloppy by the bottom of the bowl but it was good. Just not fantastic. Did n’t get to try anything else other than the raspberry lemonade which was superb. I had my heart set on it before we got two tasters and it did n’t disappoint. Definitely try it. Despite everything being good I think I be inclined to try somewhere else in the leisure park next time.,1,popped here for a quick lunch it located in the business park so handy before cinema or golf my daughter and i both had the same dish so ca n t show you many photos we were welcomed by a friendly woman they did ask about allergies which was nice my daughter and i both had the linguine carbonara it was decent it a large portion for anyone less than a teenager food came out in a reasonable time frame was well cooked the balance of the dish not quite as good as some other places but sloppy by the bottom of the bowl but it was good just not fantastic did n t get to try anything else other than the raspberry lemonade which was superb i had my heart set on it before we got two tasters and it did n t disappoint definitely try it despite everything being good i think i be inclined to try somewhere else in the leisure park next time,popped quick lunch located business park handy cinema golf daughter dish ca n t show many photo welcomed friendly woman ask allergy nice daughter linguine carbonara decent large portion anyone less teenager food came reasonable time frame well cooked balance dish not quite good place sloppy bottom bowl good not fantastic n t get try anything else raspberry lemonade superb heart set got two taster n t disappoint definitely try despite everything good think inclined try somewhere else leisure park next time

We tried a Turkish Yakut red wine which was lovely and very good value at. To start we shared Tzatziki( Cacik) and the mixed hot meze which contained spicy Turkish sausage, halloumi, falafel with hummus, calamari and feta cheese wrapped in filo pastry. Which was delicious and everyone loved it. The swordfish was very good. The mixed kebab and Adana kebab were well cooked. The vegetarian saute was a little oily. Chips were very good.

"Overall, it was a good experience that I'd recommend for doubles to families with kids. Good variety of food that should serve everyone tastes. As a vegetarian, I can say that the food was good, but the only one that wowed me was the pizza, which was made fresh in front of everyone. Service was excellent, and I watched them give that same service to everyone.

"Wish I'd read some of the reviews before booking Dune 2 in IMAX. Having never experienced a movie in 70 mm before I thought this was the perfect occasion.

"We had a disappointing visit to the King Ransom yesterday Firstly I was charged over 10 for three soft drinks which thinking back seems expensive ? Secondly after deciding on what we would like to eat, I had to return to my party twice because the food we wanted was n't available. After a good wait one sandwich arrived with two sides of cold fries. Around 5 minutes later the three remaining sandwiches and wraps arrived with the another 2 sides of cold fries. All sides of fries returned to the kitchen to re heat. Surely a basic order of sandwiches / wraps and fries should arrive at the table together ? Two of the fries were n't what we ordered also. However three of the sandwiches / wraps were nice. Then we decided to order 2 puddings but after waiting over half an hour we asked for a refund All staff apart from one girl were disengaged and unfriendly. No senior staff or management were visible. We had to clear our plates away as left sat on the table for ages. We left feeling very disappointed. You have done a lovely job doing up this pub but the staff and food do not match this.",0,we had a disappointing visit to the king ransom yesterday firstly i was charged over for three soft drinks which thinking back seems expensive secondly after deciding on what we would like to eat i had to return to my party twice because the food we wanted was n t available after a good wait one sandwich arrived with two sides of cold fries around minutes later the three remaining sandwiches and wraps arrived with the another sides of cold fries all sides of fries returned to the kitchen to re heat surely a basic order of sandwiches wraps and fries should arrive at the table together two of the fries were n t what we ordered also however three of the sandwiches wraps were nice then we decided to order puddings but after waiting over half an hour we asked for a refund all staff apart from one girl were disengaged and unfriendly no senior staff or management were visible we had to clear our plates away as left sat on the table for ages we left feeling very disappointed you have done a lovely job doing up this pub but the staff and food do not match this,disappointing visit king ransom yesterday firstly charged three soft drink thinking back seems expensive secondly deciding would like eat return party twice food wanted n t available good wait one sandwich arrived two side cold fry around minute later three remaining sandwich wrap arrived another side cold fry side fry returned kitchen heat surely basic order sandwich wrap fry arrive table together two fry n t ordered also however three sandwich wrap nice decided order pudding waiting half hour asked refund staff apart one girl disengaged unfriendly no senior staff management visible clear plate away left sat table age left feeling disappointed done lovely job pub staff food not match

"Second time visiting. A little on the pricey side in comparison to my local Indian down south. I went for the Nachodoms and they were incredible! Would highly recommend. Then I decided to go for chicken shashlik. This was very tasty, I did ask for it to be more spicy but they did n't add anything. My biggest concern was the service. I ca n't fault the people but the amount of people there was too many. We went at opening time but they literally were standing around staring and as soon as we were finished with a dish, collected it. It felt like they wanted us in and out very quickly.

"Lovely venue with friendly staff and good service. Food was varying in quality between dishes. Three of our party had a Calzone, and they all said that it was very good. I was told by another member of our group that the vegan rainbow lasagne was enjoyable if a little stodgy. The chicken calabreze was a bit burned to the bottom of the pan, and the sausage ragu did n't have much taste to it. This was reported to serving staff who took the two meals off the bill. The deserts were delicious. The waiting staff offered us the option of selecting deserts from the main menu and combining it with the Christmas 3 course offer which some of our party opted for. The kids were given colouring paper with quizes on and crayons to complete them, this was a lovely touch, thank you Update Excellent staff, very efficient on a super busy evening We had booked the table for but it was so packed that we had to stand and wait for tables to clear before being seated 15 minutes later. Staff were super apologetic and were very attentive. Food was delicious and the flat white was lovely.

"At first glance, you notice black coloured rooms that highlights the certain atmosphere and the colour style of the place making it pretty cozy to be in. However, I would add a bit more decorations to fulfill this feeling. The food itself is amazing in my opinion: it is fully packed with tasty filling which also destroys your hunger by just eating one full meal. I liked the wide range of options especially for fries, where you could choose one from 4 types of the fries. The fillings of the kebab I had are decently harmonically combined. Price are relatively low, considering that the ood is worthy. I payed 11 pounds for kebab, fries and a drink. Nothing special about the service. Although, I am really good in speaking English, the one who took my order was patient enough to repeat some questions to me. There are take-aways available No parking places A lot of space inside, so it's not difficult to find a place to sit. Decent lights.

"GOOD FOOD AND GOOD SERVICE!!! Recently I had a medium Big tasty meal there for lunch. I was glad that there were at least 8 touchscreen order machines in there and the one I used was very easy to touch. And the most important, I received my order in 7 MINUTES. This was the fastest service I received from Mcdonald in 2 months!!! The burger was warm and tasty, drink was good but just a bit disappointing that the medium fries only got half of the packet. I asked the staff to give me a cup of water and funny thing was the water had some Oasis taste with it. The toilet was relatively clean( quite impressed with the new flushing system). And a staff was just sweeping the floor and helped me remove the paper which stuck under my shoe. Thank you! In conclusion, I really enjoyed this meal!",1,good food and good service recently i had a medium big tasty meal there for lunch i was glad that there were at least touchscreen order machines in there and the one i used was very easy to touch and the most important i received my order in minutes this was the fastest service i received from mcdonald in months the burger was warm and tasty drink was good but just a bit disappointing that the medium fries only got half of the packet i asked the staff to give me a cup of water and funny thing was the water had some oasis taste with it the toilet was relatively clean quite impressed with the new flushing system and a staff was just sweeping the floor and helped me remove the paper which stuck under my shoe thank you in conclusion i really enjoyed this meal,good food good service recently medium big tasty meal lunch glad least touchscreen order machine one used easy touch important received order minute fastest service received mcdonald month burger warm tasty drink good bit disappointing medium fry got half packet asked staff give cup water funny thing water oasis taste toilet relatively clean quite impressed new flushing system staff sweeping floor helped remove paper stuck shoe thank conclusion really enjoyed meal

"I had this place on my list for a while now. I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant, with a great ambient atmosphere. We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n’t take long and the restaurant was ‘ buzzing ’, it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n’t order again. The gravy was far too thin / watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n’t want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n’t make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n’t fault it. Beautiful Menu, great atmosphere, very good staff and definitely worth it.",1,i had this place on my list for a while now i took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife a stunning restaurant with a great ambient atmosphere we got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around it did n t take long and the restaurant was buzzing it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign the menu is very good with extensive options including a tapas option the drinks menu is excellent including non alcoholic drinks and mocktails we tried the scallops which we never tried before definitely a hit this was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a min wait at least we knew it was getting cooked fresh my wife had the steak and i had the lamb i never tried a lamb dish like this a very different way of serving lamb a dish i enjoyed but sadly would n t order again the gravy was far too thin watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce the chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well a beautiful combination there are many attractive options on the menu so even if you picky there is something for everyone the dessert menu has some great options too being a diabetic i did n t want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding sadly right next to our table one of the customers passed out the restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful they did n t make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual the downside was staff put on the air con to provide the customer with some cool air which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected go cold all in all a great experience i ca n t fault it beautiful menu great atmosphere very good staff and definitely worth it,place list took opportunity book surprise meal wife stunning restaurant great ambient atmosphere got nice warm welcome service offered pretty quickly opposed wait around n t take long restaurant buzzing filled pretty quick always good sign menu good extensive option including tapa option drink menu excellent including non alcoholic drink mocktails tried scallop never tried definitely hit whilst waited main meal told would min wait least knew getting cooked fresh wife steak lamb never tried lamb dish like different way serving lamb dish enjoyed sadly would n t order gravy far thin watery chef evidently like use signature pea sauce chip peppercorn sauce along steak complimented well beautiful combination many attractive option menu even picky something everyone dessert menu great option diabetic n t want risk definitely would white chocolate pudding sadly right next table one customer passed restaurant staff accommodating helpful n t make fuss assisted getting help young individual downside staff put air con provide customer cool air meant rest restaurant food would affected go cold great experience ca n t fault beautiful menu great atmosphere good staff definitely worth

"We had a nice welcome, which was lovely. The waiter was very kind to direct us quickly to a table. However, the food was not appealing. There were 3 of us, but they only gave one small serving of bread and salad. We were meant to eat the bread with mayonnaise as opposed to humous. My aubergine said it comes with salad and rice. I got the rice, but the salad was apparently the salad we initially received with the bread. The waiter was very rude when we enquired about the salad as I am a salad lover. We were very disappointed. The chicken donner was not spiced up, just served as it is. All in all, the experience was n't worth the money we paid.

"I really love the food. Very reasonable prices, good quantity and quality of food. The ambience of the restaurant was really nice with some indoor plants which makes it warm and cozy. But the place I do n’t know for some reason it really cold when we visited so it felt a bit uncomfortable. The service was quick and good. Staff are polite. Everything pretty good except for the fact they do charge service charge and do n’t know why a person is asked to pay when it do n’t go to the staff but the restaurant itself. It would be better to tip the staff for their generous service than paying to the restaurant for god knows what. Also the service charge is bit too much to pay for a meal.

"We have been a customer of Wildwood Northwich since it opened. The food is always delicious and the wait staff lovely. Ordering for takeaway is horrendous as it is always late and cold, this is not the restaurants fault but the delivery app Uber or Just Eat, if you want a takeout then pick up, no problems there. The last few times we have eaten in there has been a few issues that were quickly rectified, missing fries and drinks, however my last visit on the 23rd my entire main meal was wrong and I ended up with chicken in my pasta, I am vegetarian and so I was quite horrified as we're the wait staff who very quickly sorted it out.

"Popped in for a quick bite as was on the go. There is local free parking nearby and a 5 mins walk over. First impressions was disappointing as only food to order machines were working and there was a queue. So i went to counter to order instead as I had a fidget baby and just wanted to get seated. The staff was busy chatting and did n’t look like they wanted to work. After standing for a few minutes, I finally got served and asked why not use the machines Made my order of a chicken wrap meal, this was reasonably priced around 6 per meal. The food came quick, was hot and restaurant was relatively clean. But no napkins and there was food amongst the floor. The food was ok, the wrap was fine, but nothing special. The chips were over cooked to a crisp and seriously seasoned, I ended up throwing these.

"I had the regular breakfast with tea, and it cost just under 13. For that price-and we're in Bolton, remember-I expected better:-eggs were not seasoned, and there was no black pepper on the table-beans were close to being cold-bacon and sausage were both very good-hash browns were limp and moist, likely to have just come out of a microwave-ketchup came in plastic sachets, which is n't what you expect when paying 10 for the food alone. Service was neither here nor there. Average, no problems. It seems like a nice place overall, but they could do with getting the details right.

"Was my friends 21st birthday yesterday. His parents booked him a table at Cosmos Sheffield, invited family from Portugal and a few close friends. We were 21 in total. The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in / out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:-( it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it! Thr manager was rude and definitely not helpful at all! All he wanted was us all sat eating quietly, out money and goodbye! Horrible experience!

"The restaurant is very well decorated inside, and has a decent atmosphere even on a Tuesday night. The staff were welcoming and in general the service was great. The wine glasses for red wine were not appropriate in my opinion, much too small. The food was pretty good, decent portion sizes and good value. The sauces accompanying them complimented the food well. So why 2 * ? There is an amount of trust you need to have between a customer and a business, and when applying an already large %( discretionary) service charge, it should be correct. Charging over 9 on a 59 bill is not right at all, and it should not be the responsibility of the customer to notice this.

"For such a large space, you have a small but delicious buffet selection. To be honest I was a little concerned when we went for dinner.

Despite the limited selection, the taste is spot on. Every dish was unique and you could see the chefs preparing each dish in the open plan kitchen. Food was replenished almost continuously and thre quality is way ahead of a lot of other buffets.

"The pizza here is consistently excellent. Having visited before, I can attest that they never fail to impress. The menu offers a variety of gourmet pizzas, including vegetarian options. Although the selection is relatively small, I often find myself torn between choices due to the diverse array of high-quality ingredients. Occasionally, they feature a special of the day, although it not available every day. On the dessert front, the tiramisu is good, though not as standout as the pizza, and it on the smaller side.

"Friendly happy service, lovely surroundings, great use of historic building. Open kitchen. Good variety of dishes on tapas menu. Curried goat was lovely, very tender and tastey. Why not a 5 across the board ? 1-Tried at to book table by phone to be told none available and last orders 9 pm, found plenty available online up to 10 pm, and booked for. Were plenty of tables on arrival and walk-ins were seated after. Took quite a while for someone to greet on arrival, despite two staff noticing quickly they did n't tell front of house. 2-music just too loud. Hard to order, one item wrong as a result but rectified quickly and taken off bill. Had work to have a conversation and everyone shouting as a result making it even louder. 3-salmon dish quite small( cold item) Good overall, with a few tweaks could be very good. Personal preference; crisp the Bravas, make mussel sauce less fishy, swap wrap for bread. Check out the dining room at left of bar, through the old safe door.

"visit to Bardo and there's an interesting concept and interior design here that could be a little confusing, but none the less colourful. Visited on Sunday, and the restaurant was n't over busy but still had to go and find a waiter to take our order. A front of house host / ess would n't go a miss here, especially for new guests to show them to a table and explain the ordering process, which is actually pre-paid at the bar. Therefore, more QSR than classic restaurant. The coffee was very good, both the hot and iced we chose. The food was tasty, and the open flat breads were presented well. The toppings were tight for the price, a little more will have been impressive.

"This has to have been the worst Hotel, l have had the misfortune to stay in, post Covid! On arrival, l was given a room on the second floor. The room was opposite the lift shaft and looked out on a flat roof and the air conditioning units, but, it was the cleanliness, or lack of it, l struggled with! It was n't the hairs and fluff in the sink, or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception, but, the hairs in the bed! At reception l apologised for complaining, but said l could n't sleep in a dirty bed. After a few visits to the room behind reception, the receptionist came back and assigned me a room on the third floor, almost directly above the first one! I duly moved to be met with a' punishment room, nowhere to sit, work, or put any of my toiletries, clothes etc, that is once l found somewhere to actually be able to open my case! However, l did n't even get that far, due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs, photos attached. I returned to reception, where l found myself apologising again and where the receptionist made it clear she was exasperated with me and basically asked me what l expected her to do with a full hotel! I explained that l would be happy just to have the sheets changed. Eventually, this is exactly what happened, the bed was changed by one of the other receptionists in the first room. So, l returned to the second floor, where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air! The toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working, as the others would not flush. We had set meal times, yesterday evening was supposed to be at 1830 hours, but, we were n't allowed in until 1925 hours, which messed up a drinks reception, due to commence in the bar area at 1930 hours, all of which had been arranged, with the hotel, weeks in advance! The food itself was n't particularly great, especially on the first evening, although, in fairness, lunch on both days, was much better. To finish it all off, this morning a few people found their cars had been broken into, windows smashed, vehicles damaged, overnight in the car park. On a more positive note, a few of the staff were lovely and helpful.",0,this has to have been the worst hotel l have had the misfortune to stay in post covid on arrival l was given a room on the second floor the room was opposite the lift shaft and looked out on a flat roof and the air conditioning units but it was the cleanliness or lack of it l struggled with it was n t the hairs and fluff in the sink or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception but the hairs in the bed at reception l apologised for complaining but said l could n t sleep in a dirty bed after a few visits to the room behind reception the receptionist came back and assigned me a room on the third floor almost directly above the first one i duly moved to be met with a punishment room nowhere to sit work or put any of my toiletries clothes etc that is once l found somewhere to actually be able to open my case however l did n t even get that far due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs photos attached i returned to reception where l found myself apologising again and where the receptionist made it clear she was exasperated with me and basically asked me what l expected her to do with a full hotel i explained that l would be happy just to have the sheets changed eventually this is exactly what happened the bed was changed by one of the other receptionists in the first room so l returned to the second floor where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air the toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working as the others would not flush we had set meal times yesterday evening was supposed to be at hours but we were n t allowed in until hours which messed up a drinks reception due to commence in the bar area at hours all of which had been arranged with the hotel weeks in advance the food itself was n t particularly great especially on the first evening although in fairness lunch on both days was much better to finish it all off this morning a few people found their cars had been broken into windows smashed vehicles damaged overnight in the car park on a more positive note a few of the staff were lovely and helpful,worst hotel l misfortune stay post covid arrival l given room second floor room opposite lift shaft looked flat roof air conditioning unit cleanliness lack l struggled n t hair fluff sink long grey hair fluff chair sent running back reception hair bed reception l apologised complaining said l could n t sleep dirty bed visit room behind reception receptionist came back assigned room third floor almost directly first one duly moved met punishment room nowhere sit work put toiletry clothes etc l found somewhere actually able open case however l n t even get far due check bed presence hair photo attached returned reception l found apologising receptionist made clear exasperated basically asked l expected full hotel explained l would happy sheet changed eventually exactly happened bed changed one receptionist first room l returned second floor l never sat chair managed work stop air conditioning unit blowing hot air toilet reception outside restaurant left lot desired one time one toilet working others would not flush set meal time yesterday evening supposed hour n t allowed hour messed drink reception due commence bar area hour arranged hotel week advance food n t particularly great especially first evening although fairness lunch day much better finish morning people found car broken window smashed vehicle damaged overnight car park positive note staff lovely helpful

"We came in to try their bottomless brunch whilst visiting over the weekend. Brunch is limited to one type of drink only for you 2 hour stay with the option to upgrade for an additional 4 which one of us did. The whole table must be doing the brunch. It was advised to choose one each that we liked, so we had the ability to swap amongst the table. Staff were very friendly and attentive, quick to bring our drinks once we had finished them. They very kindly swapped out the food on the brunch menu for a salad on which was really enjoyable. The only downside we experienced was that our table was fairly sticky, but once the drinks were poured, it was little more than an afterthought. Though with the great service the staff provided, if we had mentioned this to them, they would have resolved it.

"A truly great wee pub is the Pig. Always a nice pint can be had. Curious Brew is a favourite of mine and can be found here. It's about as traditional and atmospheric as a great British pub gets, certainly for Maidstone anyway. There's a little courtyard to catch a few rays when the sun is shining. If you're staying around for more than a couple, the best advice I can give is to watch your head when you're moving about the place!!

"Food was lovely, however I would not recommend if you are vegetarian. They served my vegetarian partner a meat samosa instead of a vegetable samosa, he took a bite and was rather upset. The staff were unapologetic and did not seem to understand the gravity of serving meat to a vegetarian. We were given 10 % off of the bill but that did not make up for the lack of customer service and apology.",0,food was lovely however i would not recommend if you are vegetarian they served my vegetarian partner a meat samosa instead of a vegetable samosa he took a bite and was rather upset the staff were unapologetic and did not seem to understand the gravity of serving meat to a vegetarian we were given off of the bill but that did not make up for the lack of customer service and apology,food lovely however would not recommend vegetarian served vegetarian partner meat samosa instead vegetable samosa took bite rather upset staff unapologetic not seem understand gravity serving meat vegetarian given bill not make lack customer service apology
"Visited while staying in Blackpool for 2 nights and pre-booked our table a few days in advance for 7 pm. Arrived on time to be told our table had been taken as a party of 6 had turned up earlier so would be available' soon'. Stood waiting for about 10 minutes then table became available. Waited on by Daniel, a very friendly & helpful staff member who took our order. The Mushroom Al Forno starters were lovely and arrived hot. Our mains, Lasagne & Pollo Cacciatore were equally as hot and very flavoursome. Apart from the initial problem upon entrance the visit was very much enjoyed and we would visit again. I would recommend to park in the Houndshill carpark if driving here as it is situated right next to Bella so perfect placement. Great food and essentially hot! * Update Dec' 23. Visited again while on a Xmas break. Had the mushroom Al Forno starter again but this time it was a disappointingly smaller portion than in July when we last visited. Ordered the lasagne as Bella IS the best but when it arrived it looked horrendous. The dish had burn marks all over it and the lasagne itself was as flat as a pancake! Not acceptable and certainly not the usual quality I receive. I called the waitress over, Karolina could not apologise enough and without excuses took my burnt dish away and 10 minutes later returned, again apologised and served me with a fresh, hot, bubbling and delicious lasange. That was much appreciated. Great service.

"Got a large mixed chicken kebab( schwarma, tikka, tandoori) and a schwarma pizza. Was really looking forward to trying for the first time as I love schwarma, was sadly lacking unfortunately, chips were under cooked both tikka and tandoori tasted the same and were dry as sticks as was the' schwarma' which was just flavoured chicken fillets. Luckily I ordered an extra garlic sauce as none came with the kebab and the salad was basic, no cabbage. The wrap that came with the kebab was beautiful though. Pizza was OK but nothing special, plus the schwarma had an overwhelming taste of cinnamon which did not go with pizza.

"Interesting exhibits, for those keen to learn about the history of the local area. Small museum, but space used cleverly to maximise the number of items they can display. The café is good value for a quick, small lunch. Soup and Sandwiches seem to be the main lunch items on offer. Limited seating with it being situated on the mezzanine level, so best to either avoid at the height of lunch time or make sure you secure a table before ordering. At the busiest times, staff are caught up with serving and are distracted, so you may have to wait a short while at the counter to order and at the till to pay.

The cappuccino did n't have the cocoa on top and nobody even offered, so l got up and poured it myself. There was an open pot with mash mallow next to it and l assumed they were free since it was open right there where you get the sugars, etc. A young blond girl on the bar said I was not allowed to take them. She did n't say it very kindly. Then the other attendant came to our table to ask for money for the 2 small marsh mallows, ridiculous.

I was here for the Half Man Half Biscuit gig Decent venue right in the centre of town. Sound was good( from right at the front) Staff were friendly and easy / quick to get in and served at the bar There was some confusion as to where the exit was though(!) and it's a trek to the toilets. Ca n't really comment on drinks as I only had water but 2 does seem a bit steep for a bottle.,1,i was here for the half man half biscuit gig decent venue right in the centre of town sound was good from right at the front staff were friendly and easy quick to get in and served at the bar there was some confusion as to where the exit was though and it is a trek to the toilets ca n t really comment on drinks as i only had water but does seem a bit steep for a bottle,half man half biscuit gig decent venue right centre town sound good right front staff friendly easy quick get served bar confusion exit though trek toilet ca n t really comment drink water seem bit steep bottle
Nicer experience than most supermarkets. The aisles are very wide so even when busy it does n't seem like it is. Fresh fruit and veg at good prices. Named Brands are cheaper than elsewhere but they do less of their own brand products so depending on what you normally purchase it can both increase and decrease your usual cost. Still a long way to go to compete with the likes of Aldi but there's far more variety and it has longer opening hours.,1,nicer experience than most supermarkets the aisles are very wide so even when busy it does n t seem like it is fresh fruit and veg at good prices named brands are cheaper than elsewhere but they do less of their own brand products so depending on what you normally purchase it can both increase and decrease your usual cost still a long way to go to compete with the likes of aldi but there is far more variety and it has longer opening hours,nicer experience supermarket aisle wide even busy n t seem like fresh fruit veg good price named brand cheaper elsewhere less brand product depending normally purchase increase decrease usual cost still long way go compete like aldi far variety longer opening hour
"3 burgers, I chips and 1 haddock for 50. I do n't mind paying that much, but the burgers were n't done to our specification.

"Google Maps Review for Popeyes: Wembley Branch. I visited the Popeyes branch in Wembley to try their breakfast roll combo meal, which seems to be a new deal via targeted email marketing.

"Unfortunately this branch has really gone down hill. For the amount we paid, I expected far better food and service. We waited a very long time for food and there were n't many people in there. The waitress was kind enough to come over and ask if we were told about the delay, which we were n't. When they food came the chicken was really dry and bland as though they did n't baste or season it on the grill. The garlic bread was rock solid it literally hurt my jaw eating it and gave me a headache. We did ask for some of the garlic breads to be replaced but the rest were inedible. We are n't complainers so we did n't say anything until we seen the manager at the very end. All he said was OK I'll let the staff know. I think maybe some of the order was ready and was waiting too long before serving which is why everything was dry and almost stale. It honestly is not worth the money, far too expensive and food very inadequette. Even the children said how bad it was. We wo n't be returning sadly.

"Having been wanting to try Tarragon since it opened I was pleased that it did not disappoint. The service was immaculate and the majority of the staff were friendly and helpful( although when we arrived I had to offer that we had a reservation). Overall, we all enjoyed the food. The English muffin with the chicken liver parfait was unbelievably good, but very small. The cassoulet with the cod lacked flavour sadly and the crumb was quite wet, but the fish was cooked well. With some fine tuning this place could be a real gem.

"This us a very old building with floors, staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old. On entering there is a bar on either side of the lobby that looks like a furniture shop. There was no one at the reception desk as she was chatting tk a bar man next door! Keys were given in an envelope but nothing else. We had to go back down 3 flights of stairs to find out the Wi-Fi code and also when breakfast was served. The room was very pretty but was not the one promised, we had a view of the kitchen vents / ducts which were quite noisy. Bed very comfortable, still and sparkling water and range of teas on tap. We were woken by rave music, very loud underneath our room that lasted for about 30 minutes. On telling reception she informed us that the kitchen does not have a sound system so it could not have been them. Breakfast room was a rabbit Warren away from where we were told, three members of staff, one being the initial receptionist were there. She appeared in the same dress as the day before but with tights that were ripped and laddered over both thighs. We sat and waited and then had to ask the youngest young lady if we could have some drinks, she was not confident at all and had to ask the other waitress if that was OK, no other was taken until we asked the waitress( who was busy doing most of the work) eventually we had our breakfast and it was good. Unfortunately others voting in afterwards were not so lucky and had cold tea and coffee served, no fruit salad or bowls and long waits for any attention.

Unfortunately the staff take it upon themselves to add their own tip to the bill, on the receipt it does state it is an optional service charge though there is no option to remove this.

"Badgers Bar & Restaurant has over 1000 Google Maps reviews and a great star rating, so my son and I decided to head here for lunch during our trip to Derry / Londonderry today. Now, I'll caveat this by saying that it seemed exceptionally busy for a Wednesday lunchtime, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked what the wait time for food would be. I did n't do this, and we ended up waiting for around 35 minutes after we'd been seated. I ordered the Badgers Beef Burger and my son the buttermilk chicken burger. Both meals come with a side of your choice. I got chunky chips, my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce. The beef burger was nice, but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry, though a mayo style dip is provided on the side. No complaints on the chicken burger from my son! The atmosphere in the bar is really nice though and the menu is extensive and well curated with a mix of traditional and contemporary meals and small plates on offer.

"A great place to relax on vacation Although the park is not big But it offers a lot more attractions than other British parks Can bring fun and satisfaction to tourists Except for the most famous tower in the middle It also has a small lake Birds often stay in the lake to rest The scenery is very pleasant There are also many very cute squirrels walking around here There is also a Bell that has been used before Introduced the previous history here But relatively The lack of space and the overcrowded parrots seem very cruel to watch... Many parrots are constantly chewing off their feathers because they are trapped here. They have to live in this poorly lit and crowded space I really do n’t recommend it...

"Easy to access from the local Motorway. The local multi-story parking is close by with a short walk through a pedestrian precinct of 100-150 m from the car( ideally level 2) to the front door of the hotel. The hotel entrance is a little underwhelming at street-level, with the reception on the first floor. Bedrooms, beds & breakfast( gluten-free, cooked to order) were great as usual for Premier Inn. Free WiFi worked well. One of two lifts was not working, but this is n't an issue when it's quiet. Also had a small issue with the shower head not locking at a good angle, but nothing too major. Noise from the town can be heard in a quiet room, but it calms down at a reasonable hour for sleep. Views over the Christmas stalls in the precinct and the city park to the south were great from our third floor full height window. Our preschoolers loved it & so did we!",1,easy to access from the local motorway the local multi story parking is close by with a short walk through a pedestrian precinct of m from the car ideally level to the front door of the hotel the hotel entrance is a little underwhelming at street level with the reception on the first floor bedrooms beds breakfast gluten free cooked to order were great as usual for premier inn free wifi worked well one of two lifts was not working but this is n t an issue when it is quiet also had a small issue with the shower head not locking at a good angle but nothing too major noise from the town can be heard in a quiet room but it calms down at a reasonable hour for sleep views over the christmas stalls in the precinct and the city park to the south were great from our third floor full height window our preschoolers loved it so did we,easy access local motorway local multi story parking close short walk pedestrian precinct car ideally level front door hotel hotel entrance little underwhelming street level reception first floor bedroom bed breakfast gluten free cooked order great usual premier inn free wifi worked well one two lift not working n t issue quiet also small issue shower head not locking good angle nothing major noise town heard quiet room calm reasonable hour sleep view christmas stall precinct city park south great third floor full height window preschooler loved

"Highly recommend to try this place out, Nice decor and aesthetics. Drinks and food is nice. The beef loaded fries were the main and best item on the menu in my opinion. As well as getting a full English breakfast, I also had a spicy chicken burger with curly fries. The spicy chicken burger was over the top spicy for me which was unexpected but still very nice. The seasonal and loaded hot chocolate was delicious. Portion sizes are great. Recommend to try atleast once. It a very nice low-key spot. Highly recommend their french toast selections and large Matilda type chocolate cake too.

"Quite enjoyed my breakfast at Hatch. It was fresh, tasty and made with quality ingredients. Visited on a weekend so it was very busy and I actually had a short wait for my table. However, the service was quick and friendly. One thing to note is that after taking a glance into the kitchen, I could see all the food was being cooked on the same grill-eggs, sausages etc. I point this out because for anyone seeking halal or even vegetarian options, the cross contamination is very problematic. Had I not seen this, I would have given Hatch a 5 star review.",1,quite enjoyed my breakfast at hatch it was fresh tasty and made with quality ingredients visited on a weekend so it was very busy and i actually had a short wait for my table however the service was quick and friendly one thing to note is that after taking a glance into the kitchen i could see all the food was being cooked on the same grill eggs sausages etc i point this out because for anyone seeking halal or even vegetarian options the cross contamination is very problematic had i not seen this i would have given hatch a star review,quite enjoyed breakfast hatch fresh tasty made quality ingredient visited weekend busy actually short wait table however service quick friendly one thing note taking glance kitchen could see food cooked grill egg sausage etc point anyone seeking halal even vegetarian option cross contamination problematic not seen would given hatch star review

Update 3 *) I went to see Matilda at 3 pm on the 1st of December the film was good but felt let down by the quality of the sound was really flat with minimal bass especially on a musical film. I paid the extra for the premier seats whilst being a different colour and a slightly higher back they really ai n't comfortable and I was starting to ache so had to keep moving about in my seat to get through the film whilst the seats look good the comfort was n't considered when they were made especially for sitting in for around 2 hours. The picture quality was really good with good brightness level. I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film. I really would like to see different straws available as the straws currently just go soggy and collapse around 20 minutes into the film I had 2 and had failed before I finished my large drink I ended up using a spare straw when I got back to my car I had from showcase wich lasted well for the rest of the drink This cinema is good but I would n't use it as my first choice as cinemas are a big part of me and the sound image and comfort are really important things to me for a great cinema experience. I do really like the screens outside so you can check the film that's showing before you go in it's a great idea and works well( picture taken as I left so shows film time of the showing after the one I watched) Original 4 *) I have n't been to a cinema in around 13 years i enjoyed my visit the person serving was friendly and really helpful we got are tickets and drinks we went for the large drinks because hey it's not a regular thing and might aswell go all out on it. The person scanning tickets could have been a bit more helpful I rely on things being made clear to me and because I seen the sign for screen one and not screen to as that was around the corner under the stairs it was difficult for me to understand wear it was the the person was friendly it would have been helpful to maby word and explain things a little different as some of us struggle with things like this also maybe move the sign for screen 2 so it can be seen as easy as screen 1 from wear the tickets get checked. The cinema was clean tidy and I really enjoyed the film we did notice that about of the way through many the Aircon came on or heating went off and started to get cold.

"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers.

I go to the cafe here from time to time as it's a bit out of the way and quiet compared to Costa etc. However I was very disappointed by the extremely small slices of cake and despite being practically empty there were several tables not cleared.

The service was very kind and polite. We ordered an elderflower drink and for starters, we had chicken gyozas. The gyozas tasted very nice and were crispy and fresh. After that, we got our ramens. We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen and have to say this is the best ramen we've ever had. The broth was very tasty, the noodles were nice, the meat was a bit thin but good, and the best part was the boiled egg! The best boiled egg I've ever had! So flavorful.

"Me and partner visited the Tim Hortons in Golden Square Warrington around today which is a Sunday. It was our first time at this particular Tim Hortons, I've never been to any Tim full stop so this was my first experience. When we arrived it was busy but not rammed, there was a queue for food' collection' which was awkwardly set up as there's not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there's a table in the way of collection also. So that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which I'm adamant does n't work in food places but they keep doing it. They could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some McDonald do but I digress. As we'd never been we used the self serve to figure out what we'd like and the menu were clear and simple, but it was so we could go and order in person as I have a blue light card. The man said Tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal / offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that. The food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer. I got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious. Thanks to the deal, for 2 meals it cost us just under 15. All in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend. The low rating for atmosphere was due to the self serve machines and collection point being where they are, when people were waiting they all seemed a but stressed. We had already eaten the food as it was delicious before thinking to take a picture-apologies!",1,me and partner visited the tim hortons in golden square warrington around today which is a sunday it was our first time at this particular tim hortons i have never been to any tim full stop so this was my first experience when we arrived it was busy but not rammed there was a queue for food collection which was awkwardly set up as there is not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there is a table in the way of collection also so that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which i am adamant does n t work in food places but they keep doing it they could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some mcdonald do but i digress as we would never been we used the self serve to figure out what we would like and the menu were clear and simple but it was so we could go and order in person as i have a blue light card the man said tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that the food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer i got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious thanks to the deal for meals it cost us just under all in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend the low rating for atmosphere was due to the self serve machines and collection point being where they are when people were waiting they all seemed a but stressed we had already eaten the food as it was delicious before thinking to take a picture apologies,partner visited tim hortons golden square warrington around today sunday first time particular tim hortons never tim full stop first experience arrived busy not rammed queue food collection awkwardly set not enough room form neat organised line end waiting around people table table way collection also side thing bit awkward self serve machine middle entire room adamant n t work food place keep could wall one side suggestion like mcdonald digress would never used self serve figure would like menu clear simple could go order person blue light card man said tim accept blue light kindly mentioned deal offer today worked cheaper appreciated food came quick came hot liked idea burger came foil possibly kept warmer longer got meatless chicken sandwich meal partner got chicken sandwich stack meal could not fault burger delicious thanks deal meal cost u good first experience visit would recommend low rating atmosphere due self serve machine collection point people waiting seemed stressed already eaten food delicious thinking take picture apology

"Really friendly staff and service. The food was better than average. The booths have the feel of an American diner / sports bar with large screens pumping out constant sports scores and interviews. In the centre there are cocktails being made, shaken, stirred all in. So overall really good experience. My guest had Calamari and then Classic burger and they were both excellent according to his aggressively omnivore diet. I had veggie options. It always makes me laugh when people assume I'm the meat eater out of two. Was n't over keen on the sachets of sauce, for the price. I'd expect a small vessel laden with the best quality sauces. The beer was too fizzy. Not sure that's a criticism!

"The architecture of the hotel is amazing, lots of construction work on the outside but they were not as noisy as expected. The hotel needs a major makeover as everything looks old and the doors are old fashioned and probably repainted 15 times. Old wall paper in walls.

Great outdoor sitting area too with parking on site. The hotel has great potential even though Southport is known for a more senior majority clientele.

The egg chowmein was not at all upto the mark. It barely had any egg and the taste was It was bland and was lacking taste and texture. Jhol momos are momos that are drowned in a bowl full of broth / gravy. The broth is supposed to be spicy but sadly, at this place, it was not. The texture was grainy and did not feel good in the mouth. Other dishes such as chilly paneer, chicken steamed momos and chicken fried rice was bang on! One weird thing-there was a really tiny pebble( we call it Kankar) when I took my first bite of the fried rice but other than that, the taste of the fried rice was really nice! I would love to go to this place again to try their thaali and fried momos. Majority of the people there were ordering the thaali so can not wait to be there again!

Excellent service. Very friendly and warm and enough could n't be done to help make your meal great. I had the three course special for 20. The starter was half of a large mushroom with salad. I felt that they could have stretched to a full mushroom however. I had a veg curry for mains and the curry flavour was lovely. I had the cheese & crackers for the third course which was lovely. The cheapest wine was a bottle and that was very nice. It was my birthday and I was given a plate with happy birthday written across it which was a lovely touch.

Hash browns, scrambled eggs, beans, bacon and sausage available buffet style as a hot choice. Some cheese and meat the pastries were on a single tray covered by a tea towel away from the main breakfast with no label so I missed them till I left.

"Had a two day meeting in Belfast. Location of the hotel was wonderful, convenient to multiple restaurants and pubs. I found metered parking outside that was free after 6 pm, only caveat was that you had to move your car by 8 am and you could only pay to park for 1 to 2 hour increments depending on the metered area. There is a paid parking garage with discounted rates for guests a short walk from the hotel, but I did not use it. Service in the hotel was exceptional. My room was very nice, clean and spacious. My only complaint was my mattress. It was clearly well used. The first night, I had a terrible sleep. I spoke with housekeeping and they explained they were in the process of replacing the mattresses and they would place extra padding on my mattress for the second night, which they did and it was 100 % better.",1,had a two day meeting in belfast location of the hotel was wonderful convenient to multiple restaurants and pubs i found metered parking outside that was free after pm only caveat was that you had to move your car by am and you could only pay to park for to hour increments depending on the metered area there is a paid parking garage with discounted rates for guests a short walk from the hotel but i did not use it service in the hotel was exceptional my room was very nice clean and spacious my only complaint was my mattress it was clearly well used the first night i had a terrible sleep i spoke with housekeeping and they explained they were in the process of replacing the mattresses and they would place extra padding on my mattress for the second night which they did and it was better,two day meeting belfast location hotel wonderful convenient multiple restaurant pub found metered parking outside free pm caveat move car could pay park hour increment depending metered area paid parking garage discounted rate guest short walk hotel not use service hotel exceptional room nice clean spacious complaint mattress clearly well used first night terrible sleep spoke housekeeping explained process replacing mattress would place extra padding mattress second night better

"The food is great, huge portions, very tasty, pretty cheap. I've always had good service when I went, but it is more like a cafe that serves big meals than a restaurant, so it's a different style of service. I would probably go here more often if they took card, as I rarely have cash on me. They also do n't have an alcohol licence, which makes perfect sense for the size and style of the place.

"We took friends to The Ava last Saturday for an anniversary meal and drinks. All of us enjoyed it. The food was good and the service was friendly. We were offered drinks as soon as we arrived after which there was a bit of a wait for food because it was extremely busy.

Nice food but not amazing. The staff are friendly & gave good service. The food came out very quickly though-you can tell they want you gone after 90 minutes so you feel rushed!

It's understandable that such a popular place has a large roll over of customers as the night goes on so i guess this can be looked at as a positive and a negative view point, it's the been told you only have half an hr left at your table and then kinda felt we are being forced out and having a staff member settling your bill on their terms... i get it and see they are thinking about new customers ect.. so it feels like ok your done guy now move on.

"A rather disappointing Bank Holiday lunch. Although there was a good selection of vegetables, the Chef carving the meat appeared to have the world sharpest knife. One would have expected at least one decent slice of meat and a couple of smaller slices( I chose only Turkey), however, despite there being well over half the turkey on display with lots of meat, he literally shaved five slivers off the base. When we last visited Lincoln, we had a couple of generous slices, sadly when I mentioned this he replied it now on weight. That fine, I understand the business has to make a profit, overheads are a killer, but he did not weigh anything and just guessed at what he was serving up. Our group of four were all shocked as to the amount we received so it was not just myself. On top of that, the restaurant was very quiet with only a handful of filled tables, we sat for nearly half an hour after finishing our meals before the waitress came to our table. Again, had they been busy serving lots of tables this would have been acceptable, but that was not the case. I do n’t know whether this review reflects all Toby Carvery restaurants, or whether this is just applicable to Lincoln, but we wo n’t be in a hurry to return to Toby Carvery, when there are so many eating establishment that offer true “ value for money ”.",0,a rather disappointing bank holiday lunch although there was a good selection of vegetables the chef carving the meat appeared to have the world sharpest knife one would have expected at least one decent slice of meat and a couple of smaller slices i chose only turkey however despite there being well over half the turkey on display with lots of meat he literally shaved five slivers off the base when we last visited lincoln we had a couple of generous slices sadly when i mentioned this he replied it now on weight that fine i understand the business has to make a profit overheads are a killer but he did not weigh anything and just guessed at what he was serving up our group of four were all shocked as to the amount we received so it was not just myself on top of that the restaurant was very quiet with only a handful of filled tables we sat for nearly half an hour after finishing our meals before the waitress came to our table again had they been busy serving lots of tables this would have been acceptable but that was not the case i do n t know whether this review reflects all toby carvery restaurants or whether this is just applicable to lincoln but we wo n t be in a hurry to return to toby carvery when there are so many eating establishment that offer true value for money,rather disappointing bank holiday lunch although good selection vegetable chef carving meat appeared world sharpest knife one would expected least one decent slice meat couple smaller slice chose turkey however despite well half turkey display lot meat literally shaved five sliver base last visited lincoln couple generous slice sadly mentioned replied weight fine understand business make profit overhead killer not weigh anything guessed serving group four shocked amount received not top restaurant quiet handful filled table sat nearly half hour finishing meal waitress came table busy serving lot table would acceptable not case n t know whether review reflects toby carvery restaurant whether applicable lincoln wo n t hurry return toby carvery many eating establishment offer true value money

Lots of storage space for your belongings. Hot water and tea and coffee was available. The bathroom showing some wear and tear, but everything works well and Dove products for hair, body and hands was a nice touch. Room was fairly quiet and the heating was silent. The quietest I enjoyed. Room darkness: 99 %. The curtains overlap not allowing any outside light in. Amenities: hot water kettle large TV Free WiFi: Staff was very pleasant and friendly with a smile.

"The service at this hotel is top quality with nightly turn down service and friendly staff. Our card key stopped working and the doorman walked all the way to our room on the third floor to let us in, then went back to reception to get us a new key and came all the way back again! We stayed in a deluxe room which is one up from their cheapest room but it was lovely and quite spacious with a seating area, large double bed( 2 singles) and a shower over a bath. The decor is a little dated as this is an older hotel but the location was very central. The shopping centre car park has an entrance directly into the hotel on the 2nd floor. The room was very quiet on the first night but we could hear our neighbours on the other nights, however no noise from outside the window which was great.

"I rather liked the Benjamin Huntsman when I visited on a recent trip to Sheffield. Located at the top of Cambridge St, it is only round the corner from another Wetherspoons, the Wather Works. Benjamin Huntsman was notable for this steel producing town as he invented crucible or cast steel & he opened a plant in Sheffield around 1740.

Overall: Mid way commercial cinema experience between The Everyman and The Odeon. Good for Wimbledon which let face it that despite best efforts is pretty run down and soulless.( I think I speak with reasonable authority having been born and raised in SW19 and seen the downward decline in the name of modernisation over the last 50 years) Expect conventional but reasonably comfortable seats on a slight incline to allow good viewing. You not going to get the luxurious sofa with little tables and high quality seat service like The Everyman but you are a cut above the boring Odeon chain. You feel like you part of something in the middle. You are. Food: Nice selection of snacks. What I liked: • 14 per ticket( non member rate) • Reasonable food and drink offering • Colour themed screens • Friendly staff • The have special screenings adapted for those with different requirements. • Good value membership schemes for cinema aficionados What I did n’t like: • Over priced popcorn • No one actually checked our tickets on entry so could easily have walked straight in. Conversely this makes me question the security. • Not quite enough of an incline on the seating meaning it was a stretch most of the time to look over peoples heads to read the subtitles Do I recommend going ? YES Will I go again ? YES Was it good value ?

"Went to the restaurant with a couple of work colleagues. The restaurant is quite spacious, very well decorated walls, and also nicely divided in smaller sections with tables for small or large groups.

"Came here for a Christmas party, the decor is gorgeous and the actual design of the restaurant is lovely( especially with all the Christmas decorations too). The food was a set 3 course meal( please ensure you read the small print when booking as sometimes you can only get 3 course instead of the 2 course option), I had sweet potato & goat cheese tart( 5), turkey kebab( 3), and the cookie dough pie( 4). I ca n’t recommend the sweet potato & goat cheese tart enough, the turkey kebab was okay but required a lot of chewing and felt like more of a ‘ wow factor ’ through how it looked than how it tasted, and the cookie dough pie was lovely but very filling! Overall, a great place to come for a Christmas party, the staff were very friendly and the place itself was really nice.",1,came here for a christmas party the decor is gorgeous and the actual design of the restaurant is lovely especially with all the christmas decorations too the food was a set course meal please ensure you read the small print when booking as sometimes you can only get course instead of the course option i had sweet potato goat cheese tart turkey kebab and the cookie dough pie i ca n t recommend the sweet potato goat cheese tart enough the turkey kebab was okay but required a lot of chewing and felt like more of a wow factor through how it looked than how it tasted and the cookie dough pie was lovely but very filling overall a great place to come for a christmas party the staff were very friendly and the place itself was really nice,came christmas party decor gorgeous actual design restaurant lovely especially christmas decoration food set course meal please ensure read small print booking sometimes get course instead course option sweet potato goat cheese tart turkey kebab cookie dough pie ca n t recommend sweet potato goat cheese tart enough turkey kebab okay required lot chewing felt like wow factor looked tasted cookie dough pie lovely filling overall great place come christmas party staff friendly place really nice

Visited twice. No waiting at the bar got served straight away by very friendly staff on both occasions. Plenty of room with seating upstairs as well I believe.

"Occupying an imposing corner plot near to Drypool bridge. They serve a good range of ales as well as the usual drinks. Main bar area at the front and then follows a large seating area with big TVs playing the daily sports events. We'd booked a table for food and was n't disappointed with the tasty Hull Pies with chips / mash, peas and gravy. It can get quite noisy with those watching the TV but it's worth a visit. Not a great deal of parking nearby only on the street and pay display.",1,occupying an imposing corner plot near to drypool bridge they serve a good range of ales as well as the usual drinks main bar area at the front and then follows a large seating area with big tvs playing the daily sports events we would booked a table for food and was n t disappointed with the tasty hull pies with chips mash peas and gravy it can get quite noisy with those watching the tv but it is worth a visit not a great deal of parking nearby only on the street and pay display,occupying imposing corner plot near drypool bridge serve good range ale well usual drink main bar area front follows large seating area big tv playing daily sport event would booked table food n t disappointed tasty hull pie chip mash pea gravy get quite noisy watching tv worth visit not great deal parking nearby street pay display
"I like to preface this by saying I had an incredible time at the 80 night and previously at the Frank Sinatra gig performed by the same great people. However, there were people who bought tickets for their family as they were assured through someone higher up that under 18s were allowed and once they got there, any underage people were kicked out despite it being a very family friendly event. If this was because it was an event open to the public let me turn that around and mention the fact that bar staff were not informed that tickets were open to the public and instead, when asked about what the event was were told “ it a private party ”. The lack of marketing for this event compared to others was shocking and the fact the people running it rang to check if under 18s were allowed multiple times and they were then turned away was abysmal. For an event this quality with such an intricate amount of attention on detail and organisation, it was disappointing they were treated like this.",0,i like to preface this by saying i had an incredible time at the night and previously at the frank sinatra gig performed by the same great people however there were people who bought tickets for their family as they were assured through someone higher up that under s were allowed and once they got there any underage people were kicked out despite it being a very family friendly event if this was because it was an event open to the public let me turn that around and mention the fact that bar staff were not informed that tickets were open to the public and instead when asked about what the event was were told it a private party the lack of marketing for this event compared to others was shocking and the fact the people running it rang to check if under s were allowed multiple times and they were then turned away was abysmal for an event this quality with such an intricate amount of attention on detail and organisation it was disappointing they were treated like this,like preface saying incredible time night previously frank sinatra gig performed great people however people bought ticket family assured someone higher allowed got underage people kicked despite family friendly event event open public let turn around mention fact bar staff not informed ticket open public instead asked event told private party lack marketing event compared others shocking fact people running rang check allowed multiple time turned away abysmal event quality intricate amount attention detail organisation disappointing treated like

What a great venue for a gig. We went to watch the ZUTONS here Situated in what looks like an old trading yard. It's got a funky Carribbean vibe with a great outdoor area for some fantastic street food and seating. A few indoor booths for keeping the rain off. A tidy venue for live music and I hope it keeps getting well supported to keep live music alive. Beer was priced fairly with reds stripe at 5 a pint. The staff were really friendly. The bouncers could do with some improvement they came across as arrogant and a little aggressive. If you do n't expect the Ritz and expect a funky friendly Carribbean live music and street food venue then you wo n't go wrong.

"I have to say we had a fantastic time at The Ivy for Friendsmas! The customer service was sensitive and perceptive. The food is consistently perfect. I attended the previous day too for my sister birthday but the Salmon was not available. Positively, I was able to eat the salmon at Friendsmas. It was worth the wait. It is the Ivy attention to detail that remains second to none. We had Christmas crackers and a wonderful booth for our meal together. The had the ice cream dessert which came with generous sized biscuits. I could have ordered two!! The only down side was the fact that the restaurant was quite busy due to the time of year. Towards the end we were slightly rushed as there was another booking. I wished there was more space in the venue to relax after eating. We would have spent more had there been space to lounge.

"were a few things I did n't understand, and I think it's very unnecessary, first of all, the security guards who met you at the door take you through the passport check-in, as if they're taking you through the bag check-in, the top search check-in, the ticket check-out, and the water you have on you, they Decoy you to security in detail, so this security is too much of an exaggeration, because we're going to enter a roller coaster on the bottom Another issue that I'm uncomfortable with is that sometimes on the roller rink we stepped aside to take a breath and relax, I was n't even allowed to take a photo with my friend, we were standing in a place where we would n't disturb anyone, the skating officials inside told us to get off the rink to relax, was it worth getting off the rink for a minute, it's really ridiculous The staff inside are very respectful and very in love with their work people standing at the door motivated us very much with the style of the cloakroom gentleman and his smiling face.

Only thing we were n't too happy about was being seated by a huge table celebrating an 18th birthday party. Our evening was constantly disturbed & the table seemed to think they were the only ones in the restaurant! No awareness for anyone around them. Perhaps huge tables like this could have an area for themselves next time to save us getting constantly knocked by people while trying to enjoy our evening. Other than this everything was amazing.

"What a shame, we were so looking forward to this place but it just did n't live up to expectations at all. It's a nice venue, and service is pretty good albeit a little clinical. We ordered some burgers and sides, the buffalo strips being really good( although they did taste like deep fried chicken soaked in Frank Hot Sauce) and the loaded fries were also good. The issue however was with the burgers... and it's not they really TASTED of it, but they smelt like a cow shed! I get it, it's beef but I want to taste and smell BEEF not COW. It was a mix of meat and... well, cow s * * * as my darling wife put it. It just completely put us off, whether it was a bad batch, or it's meant to be like that I'm not sure but was completely not for us. We left half of our food( see the pic), and no one questioned anything, did n't even ask if everything was okay-just cleared up and brought the bill. We booked for 7 pm-by we were walking out the door having been served, disappointed and paid! Compared to the Beefy Boys, you have a long long way to go, but we really did want to try( and like) somewhere else-it's just not this place, at all.

"Very dark in this establishment. Could just be the overall vibe they are trying to achieve. Service was decent, but I feel like we waited a long time for our orders to be taken. The wagyu bao buns were AMAZING! It's a shame that the starter was better than the main.. Moving onto the mains. Black angus steak, I believe, and chicken something. Ca n't remember the name. Will link pictures. The steak was very salty, and the peppercorn sauce made me feel kind of sick. Never had this problem before with any other shop.

We came here for dinner and booked a table for when we arrived at a walk in couple were stood in front of us. The staff sat the couple down on a table and then we had to wait until around for our table to be ready this was the only issue. We both had a pizza I had the salami and my partner had the portobello pizza. We had the alioli dip and the chilli honey dip which is amazing highly recommend. The only other issue is they use the restaurant as a storage area for drinks and empty pizza boxes which makes the place seem a bit scruffy.,1,we came here for dinner and booked a table for when we arrived at a walk in couple were stood in front of us the staff sat the couple down on a table and then we had to wait until around for our table to be ready this was the only issue we both had a pizza i had the salami and my partner had the portobello pizza we had the alioli dip and the chilli honey dip which is amazing highly recommend the only other issue is they use the restaurant as a storage area for drinks and empty pizza boxes which makes the place seem a bit scruffy,came dinner booked table arrived walk couple stood front u staff sat couple table wait around table ready issue pizza salami partner portobello pizza alioli dip chilli honey dip amazing highly recommend issue use restaurant storage area drink empty pizza box make place seem bit scruffy

"Arriving at the Ivy Asia on a wet Manchester evening was a bit bemused at the refusal by staff to accept the collapsible umbrella in case they lost it! Well, do n't lose it then. So we dine with a wet umbrella. The decor is stunning, the food really good, but the service, sadly lacking. Did n't appreciate our server breaking off to talk to another member of staff whilst we were ordering. Decided to go for small plates, all of which arrived in good time and were delicious. No complaints whatsoever there. But after that, no one was interested in us. Seemed that most, not all, of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners. Friends ? Local celebrity ? The restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service.

"As food chains go this one is beautifully designed perfectly located and well staffed. On entrance we were greeted by a very enthusiastic member of staff in a very Americanised manner, over excited and loud, but and it a big but, she was nice and polite. We were ushered to our table and directed to use the QR code to order our food. Now we have two points of view about this visit, my son said he would have preferred the personal touch the more human approach and did not enjoy the experience of not ordering directly to a real person. I on the other hand can kind of understand what he meant but was ok with the way I ordered the food. I scanned the QR code and ordered and paid for the food via Apple Pay. The food arrived quite quickly and was as ordered. My son again complained that he would have liked someone to tell him where the plates and sauces were. So in a matter of minutes we had three members of staff including the manager asks us if everything was ok. Being British it felt a bit much, but actually they were very polite. The food was as always was consistent so chicken is chicken, not much to talk about here. The restaurant is very modern and spacious and there was a mixture of age groups and families eating in. The decor is well designed and interesting. They have plenty of space inside and outside under parasols but today it was raining and a bit cold so no one outside.

"Pretty poor service, I'm not surprised no one was there. Walked in to a empty venue, after been greeted at the door we was given 1 menu between two of us and said just sit where ever. not a good start. Once we sat down I decided to get my own menu as we was n't given two. Poor... Waiting for table service, which never came, I saw a lady doing some sweeping. After trying to get her attention quite loudly, I found out she had AirPods in. Not good. Once she decided to not ignore us anymore she told us to go to the counter to order which we was never told at the begging. We had to shout through a thick plastic barrier.

"Very tasty sweet just like or better than home. All sweet I tried are tasty and fresh. However, since cakes etc never goes on offers to finish them daily, therefore, sometime the stocks get old and may not be fresh. Gulaab jamen with khoya are the best I think. Bought sweet and half kg jalebi on 16. Service could be made better but typical desi owners I believe, the same staff serve from morning till night, and it is difficult to maintain the cool in such long hours shifts.

"We had a buffet style meal here for our work Christmas get together.

The cocktail deals were very good and the staff helpful when using the app. Overall I'd say if you're looking for an inexpensive casual night this is n't the right venue for you, but if you're celebrating and would rather pay a little more for good quality then go ahead and book.",1,we had a buffet style meal here for our work christmas get together the service was prompt considering it was a busy night last friday before christmas so i was pleasantly surprised by the speed and also the quality of the food was very good the cocktail deals were very good and the staff helpful when using the app overall i would say if you are looking for an inexpensive casual night this is n t the right venue for you but if you are celebrating and would rather pay a little more for good quality then go ahead and book,buffet style meal work christmas get together service prompt considering busy night last friday christmas pleasantly surprised speed also quality food good cocktail deal good staff helpful using app overall would say looking inexpensive casual night n t right venue celebrating would rather pay little good quality go ahead book

"As a Christmas gift, my wife and I went for an Afternoon Tea. This is something we do every year and we try out the different ones around Tunbridge Wells. Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n’t see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n’t think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n’t risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n’t quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n’t hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more. There are other local Afternoon Teas that blow this out of the water.",0,as a christmas gift my wife and i went for an afternoon tea this is something we do every year and we try out the different ones around tunbridge wells sadly this did not live up to expectations when we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in we waited there for around minutes before being seen to nobody else was there one person walked by and said they would be back but we did n t see them again when we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day we got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so i asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our afternoon tea when our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it one of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted if we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes the sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry the scones i do n t think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n t risen they tasted ok but quite dense we used up the cream and jam with the first scones so we asked if we could have some more when it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell we tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n t quite right when we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef we did n t hear what their opinion was on the whole i say it was all round a poor experience with the status this hotel has i definitely expected more there are other local afternoon teas that blow this out of the water,christmas gift wife went afternoon tea something every year try different one around tunbridge well sadly not live expectation first turned greeted told go bistro check waited around minute seen nobody else one person walked said would back n t see finally got seen felt like inconvenience day got sat table window sun beating asked could sit sun hot wanted enjoy afternoon tea food arrived told plate left one sweet thing pair ice cream ball stick advised eat quickly melted stayed original table would melted matter minute sandwich felt like made day stored fridge served cold slightly hard dry scone n t think cooked right flat n t risen tasted ok quite dense used cream jam first scone asked could bought u noticed new cream slightly odd smell tried little bit agreed definitely n t quite right told thought might way took back kitchen ask chef n t hear opinion whole say round poor experience status hotel definitely expected local afternoon tea blow water

"Not been here for years... not that much into gambling but lots of work nights out tend to elect for this place, and that was the purpose of this visit. The food is absolutely smashing! A great selection of really tasty, decent sized meals at surprisingly reasonable prices! They do some great deals that include a 3 course meal and a drink for 35( at mar 2024) Atmosphere in the restaurant was really nice... Seemed to be a lot of bigger groups like ours I imagine doing similar things with work. Service was prompt and good. I have never really been in the casino bit properly before now, and it was really busy. The free bet you get with your meal is restricted to a few of the slot machines around the edges rather than the table games, so it was a bit weird to me, watching all these elderly people feeding their pension into slot machines, but if they're enjoying it I suppose we all have our vice!

"We dined here this evening for the Wednesday Steak Night Deal( buy 2 steaks and receive a complimentary bottle of wine and 3 sauces-black garlic mayo, bordelaise sauce, tomato & harissa ketchup). It a very good deal and the restaurant was full when we arrived so it clearly popular. There was a great atmosphere buzzing with happy diners and drinkers. Service was a bit slow but friendly and our rump steaks were a little overcooked. When we ordered, we were asked how we wanted them cooked so we asked what the chef would suggest and were told this would be medium rare which we agreed to, but they were more medium to well done. This was not a massive problem as the meat was good quality, not fatty and very tasty. We did n’t complain but our waitress asked how everything was so we told her. What was really good was that the manager came straight over and offered to bring out new steaks for us but we were hungry( we waited around 50 mins already) so said we eat them but he did offer us a complimentary dessert which was very much appreciated. The cheese platter we selected was delicious and absolutely huge so more than enough for us to share.

"My first visit arranged by my daughter. Popular and booking was essential for tables inside and out. As the weather was good we'd booked a table for 4 outside. There was a live DJ which although fabulous was a notch, or two, too loud. We struggled to converse and the staff kept asking us to repeat our orders. We moved table twice with consent of staff to support my hearing loss. This helped us immensely. The staff were helpful and checked in regularly to ensure we had everything we needed. The selection of drinks were good, as was the food. The facilities were good and clean, although they were upstairs there was an accessible toilet outside too. We spent a few very enjoyable hours here. The atmosphere was perfect for celebrating on this occasion.",1,my first visit arranged by my daughter popular and booking was essential for tables inside and out as the weather was good we would booked a table for outside there was a live dj which although fabulous was a notch or two too loud we struggled to converse and the staff kept asking us to repeat our orders we moved table twice with consent of staff to support my hearing loss this helped us immensely the staff were helpful and checked in regularly to ensure we had everything we needed the selection of drinks were good as was the food the facilities were good and clean although they were upstairs there was an accessible toilet outside too we spent a few very enjoyable hours here the atmosphere was perfect for celebrating on this occasion,first visit arranged daughter popular booking essential table inside weather good would booked table outside live dj although fabulous notch two loud struggled converse staff kept asking u repeat order moved table twice consent staff support hearing loss helped u immensely staff helpful checked regularly ensure everything needed selection drink good food facility good clean although upstairs accessible toilet outside spent enjoyable hour atmosphere perfect celebrating occasion

"Busy little coffee shop with solid breakfast selections. We went with the salmon and bacon eggs Benedict with extra side of sausages. Perfectly poached eggs without the yucky translucent bits.

Was very busy but we did n't have to wait for a table probably because there was only 2 of us. There was background music but was drowned out by everyone talking loudly.

"I been into a few of these and they have been good. Walsall chaiiwala was an experience though seriously, as we sat down in the booth it was dirty especially the menu, the food came in 3 different times, no apologies but a ‘ there you go ’ attitude, the lady server( little chubby one, with light eyes) was serving us like she was doing us a favour, it got a little busy when a few customers came in at the same time and she was flapping it ? But no service with a smile felt like she was n’t interested and the funny thing was they hide the napkins and only put out a few at a time ? ?

"I went to a Roman bath last Sunday, and it was really cool! The place was full of history. There were big pools of warm water, just like the Romans used to have. The building itself was old and beautiful, with lots of fancy pillars and statues. It felt like stepping back in time. They also had these interesting displays with artifacts and information about how the Romans lived. I learned a lot about their daily routines and traditions. One thing to keep in mind is that it can get pretty crowded, especially on weekends. So, it's a good idea to go early if you want to avoid the crowds. Overall, I had a great time at the Roman bath.

"At Mr Singh all vegetarian restaurant & takeaway vegetarians are treated to a delightful selection of meat-free alternatives that rival their carnivorous counterparts. From hot dogs to chicken burgers, tandoori chicken-style pizzas and delicious French fries, Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes. The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish, the chilli paneer pizza, which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite, which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu. While the food impresses, the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch. The décor and furnishings appear dated, detracting slightly from the overall dining experience for those choosing to dine in-restaurant. The Service is satisfactory but could be more attentive to elevate the dining experience further. As far as beverages go, Unfortunately, the milkshakes leave something to be desired, lacking the thick, creamy texture that milkshake aficionados crave. In conclusion, Mr Singh offers a vegetarian haven for those seeking flavorful meat-free options. While there are areas for improvement, such as updating the ambiance and refining the milkshake offerings, the delicious food makes it a worthwhile dining destination for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

"We came here for brunch because the menu looked delicious. We had the shakshuka, poached eggs with Chorizo, and pancakes with berries. Great flavours, but a couple of small disappointments: poached eggs were over cooked and the flatbread was rock hard. But we enjoyed our meal overall. No kids options, so quite pricey as had to order adult portions.

"I recently went to Stratford Picturehouse to see the movie Challengers, which was great might I add. However, just as the movie came to an end and the credits came on, I turned on the flash on my phone so that I could pick up my bag and there it was, a baby mouse! Yuck yuck, I simply lost my mind( as rodents are my biggest fear) I immediately grabbed my stuff and ran out the cinema like a woman on fire! I was absolutely terrified and shaking. I reported my awful experience to a member of staff who was both helpful and respectful. She brought me to her Supervisor, who then called for a Manager, who was very apologetic and did take immediate action by closing down screen 3 for cleaning / pest control visit and also gifted me with two complimentary tickets to be used at any of the Pictrehouses. I really thankful that happened at the ending of the movie, as opposed to somewhere during it, as everybody in that auditorium would have had their movie spoiled by all of my screaming!

"Went for an early dinner during the week. The thing that immediately hits u is the cleanliness which is incredibly high. People are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters. We ordered from a menu in Chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food. Despite the reputation of the Sichuan region of China I must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way. One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate. Food is actually abundant, well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in. I recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent Cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon.",1,went for an early dinner during the week the thing that immediately hits you is the cleanliness which is incredibly high people are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters we ordered from a menu in chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food despite the reputation of the sichuan region of china i must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way one is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in china but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate food is actually abundant well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in i recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon,went early dinner week thing immediately hit cleanliness incredibly high people friendly relaxed customer waiter ordered menu chinese make easier understand actually food despite reputation sichuan region china must say flavour every dish tried seemed sedate blander way one expecting explosion flavour assault sens china flavour civilised adapted less fiery palate food actually abundant well cooked balanced pleasure dine recommend want try something different omnipresent cantonese restaurant city without risk becoming fire breathing dragon

Update: have been a few times now and the food has n't been up scratch. There is always something missing in one of our meals. Latest one was ordering an ultimate burger which was missing the bacon. Went to The White Sawn for lunch. Had to get past people smoking right outside the door. Once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table. We ordered from the app; the drinks and food arrived promptly after. The pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate. It was generously topped as well and tasted good. The fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons. Overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes. The only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance( maybe they should move the smoking area)!,0,update have been a few times now and the food has n t been up scratch there is always something missing in one of our meals latest one was ordering an ultimate burger which was missing the bacon went to the white sawn for lunch had to get past people smoking right outside the door once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table we ordered from the app the drinks and food arrived promptly after the pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate it was generously topped as well and tasted good the fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes the only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance maybe they should move the smoking area,update time food n t scratch always something missing one meal latest one ordering ultimate burger missing bacon went white sawn lunch get past people smoking right outside door inside ample seating managed get nice clean table ordered app drink food arrived promptly pizza ordered right size advertised roughly size plate generously topped well tasted good fish chip also cooked well got reasonable portion chip comparison small portion weatherspoons overall good experience fast service good portion size negative prepared go past people sitting smoking right entrance maybe move smoking area

"The food was amazing! The flavors blended nicely and they were good sized portions. The Kingston chicken was impeccable with a crunchy outer layer, yet moist and well cooked inside. It was well seasoned and we would order it again for sure. We also recommend the jerk wings, very flavorful and the jerk sauce complimented them nicely. The last thing we had was the shrimp and potato curry with rice. It was rich and flavorful, not too heavy at all, and well garnished The only downside was that our service was not good as they never came to check on us unless we waved somebody down, which even that took awhile.

"The manager was excellent in helping me to navigate what I could eat( Coeliac) on their menu. I heard him tell the chefs too which reassured me. My daughter enjoyed her child meal of chicken wings and the quantity was bigger than I thought for the price. My only negative is the price. I paid for what was essentially a small piece of chicken, chip spice chips and a small coleslaw. There are no GF bred options.",1,the manager was excellent in helping me to navigate what i could eat coeliac on their menu i heard him tell the chefs too which reassured me my daughter enjoyed her child meal of chicken wings and the quantity was bigger than i thought for the price my only negative is the price i paid for what was essentially a small piece of chicken chip spice chips and a small coleslaw there are no gf bred options,manager excellent helping navigate could eat coeliac menu heard tell chef reassured daughter enjoyed child meal chicken wing quantity bigger thought price negative price paid essentially small piece chicken chip spice chip small coleslaw no gf bred option
"I had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night When I went to order at the counter, the staff told me to use the self-service kiosks instead. While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n’t receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n’t know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station. I left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions, poor service and difficult technology. I hope Burger King can work out these kinks because I believe there is an opportunity to improve.",0,i had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night when i went to order at the counter the staff told me to use the self service kiosks instead while i understand they are promoting this new technology the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach i did n t receive a paper receipt at the end after waiting minutes to receive my food i noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food keeping food warm in the fry station multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards while most of the staff seemed totally lost only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing i do n t know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station i left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions poor service and difficult technology i hope burger king can work out these kinks because i believe there is an opportunity to improve,disappointing experience restaurant last night went order counter staff told use self service kiosk instead understand promoting new technology young blonde woman came across rude approach n t receive paper receipt end waiting minute receive food noticed concerning practice like staff picking nose preparing food keeping food warm fry station multiple staff member untidy uniform one wearing apron made wonder general hygiene standard staff seemed totally lost two employee stood positive way knew n t know name tall man glass back female employee bagging order fry station left feeling disappointed unclean condition poor service difficult technology hope burger king work kink believe opportunity improve

"Visited twice. Once Sunday night, and then for a lovely cooked vegan friendly breakfast. Busy Sunday night, the bar team was n't very aware of who was next at the bar, leaving me waiting a while to be served while others jumped in, and my drink had to be repoured as the lemonade syrup had gone. But once I got their attention and they helped me, they were really friendly and kind. My partner went to the bar to order breakfast, so I did n't have any interaction with the bar team Monday morning, but the food was delicious and absolutely incredible value for money. Love their vegan cooked breakfasts. I do get extra mushrooms, tomatoes, and a hashbrown as it's not quite big enough for a treat day breakfast. But amazing value all the same. Toilets are downstairs, by the way, for anyone visiting.

It was just a shame about the service, the two waiters we had did n't seem to want to be there, and the bill took a while to come and our plates were n't even cleared and the restaurant was very quiet.

This is a friendly pub situated in the centre of Tamworth. Situated around the room are several televisions showing an assortment of football matches. The locals created a very mature and friendly atmosphere without the younger element. Food was served which was hot. On my visit I enjoyed a great meat pie which came with a lot of meat. Some gravy to compliment would have been good. I will visit again. A great selection of beers too.,1,this is a friendly pub situated in the centre of tamworth situated around the room are several televisions showing an assortment of football matches the locals created a very mature and friendly atmosphere without the younger element food was served which was hot on my visit i enjoyed a great meat pie which came with a lot of meat some gravy to compliment would have been good i will visit again a great selection of beers too,friendly pub situated centre tamworth situated around room several television showing assortment football match local created mature friendly atmosphere without younger element food served hot visit enjoyed great meat pie came lot meat gravy compliment would good visit great selection beer

Hmmmm now this is the one! Kinda pricey for what your getting TBH and TBF but it is Five Guys I suppose! I went with my small family( 4 of us) and paid just over 70. Can I also say, I did n't get a load of extra fries like I've seen people get on online videos in the past so knocking a point off for that The price is not toooooo bad for a meal out but for a few burgers n shakes n fries hmmmm that's debatable Anywayyyy!

Finally there was a small piece of wrapping plastic in my brothers dinner! We alerted them to this but the waiter basically ignored it and nothing was further said or done by them!

Really nice food and drinks and our server was really nice. The desert was also really nice and the prices of all the food were fair considering it is pretty popular and is apart of the restaurant on the show first dates.

"Great stay room was nice and bed was comfortable, dinner was a reasonable price for 3 courses bit small portions but not too bad, the service was remarkably slow though, I did find out later there was a bit party in another room that got priority over the individual guests so about 40 minutes between courses though I saw another guys that was at least an hour.

"A sophisticated cocktail bar that also serves as an Indian restaurant( I have not yet had the opportunity to sample the cuisine). The cocktails are of exceptional quality, albeit somewhat pricey. The atmosphere inside is warm and inviting, reminiscent of a bustling metropolis rather than a quaint town. The service for drink orders at the bar was slightly tardy, but this is understandable considering the high volume of customers on a Saturday evening. Overall, it is a delightful local establishment.",1,a sophisticated cocktail bar that also serves as an indian restaurant i have not yet had the opportunity to sample the cuisine the cocktails are of exceptional quality albeit somewhat pricey the atmosphere inside is warm and inviting reminiscent of a bustling metropolis rather than a quaint town the service for drink orders at the bar was slightly tardy but this is understandable considering the high volume of customers on a saturday evening overall it is a delightful local establishment,sophisticated cocktail bar also serf indian restaurant not yet opportunity sample cuisine cocktail exceptional quality albeit somewhat pricey atmosphere inside warm inviting reminiscent bustling metropolis rather quaint town service drink order bar slightly tardy understandable considering high volume customer saturday evening overall delightful local establishment

"The decor and atmosphere is lovely. But that's as good as it gets, so lower your expectations for the food. Service is incredibly slow, food arrives barely warm and glasses arrive dirty. You'd expect that for a place with stars( currently November 2023), that the food would be great too. With a menu that is heavily aimed towards their' signature' hanging kebabs, you'd at least expect them to be good. Honestly, they were the driest kebabs I've ever had, apart from the one time I tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager. Haha. The pictures really appear more juicy than they are. The chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just.. cold. Really not good enough for the price they charge. Looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails( 80 % ice) and are also waiting for too long for their meals. A table behind me of just 4 guests had to ask twice where their food was, with 10 minute intervals. Oh and the rocket was barely fresh at all. Sadly, a really disappointing experience.",0,the decor and atmosphere is lovely but that is as good as it gets so lower your expectations for the food service is incredibly slow food arrives barely warm and glasses arrive dirty you would expect that for a place with stars currently november that the food would be great too with a menu that is heavily aimed towards their signature hanging kebabs you would at least expect them to be good honestly they were the driest kebabs i have ever had apart from the one time i tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager haha the pictures really appear more juicy than they are the chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just cold really not good enough for the price they charge looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails ice and are also waiting for too long for their meals a table behind me of just guests had to ask twice where their food was with minute intervals oh and the rocket was barely fresh at all sadly a really disappointing experience,decor atmosphere lovely good get lower expectation food service incredibly slow food arrives barely warm glass arrive dirty would expect place star currently november food would great menu heavily aimed towards signature hanging kebab would least expect good honestly driest kebab ever apart one time tried make scratch using oven teenager haha picture really appear juicy chicken took actual force get fork prawn kebab cold really not good enough price charge looking around past greenery chic decoration see several couple finished cocktail ice also waiting long meal table behind guest ask twice food minute interval oh rocket barely fresh sadly really disappointing experience

The chips are always dirty looking like they been cooked in used oil and are always dry and tasteless. The rice is quite often stuck together and a lot of it is brown like it been over cooked.

"Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions. Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits.

"I just went swimming here for the first time with my daughter. We had lots of fun, it's great pool with a good wave machine, bubbles and two brilliant flumes. The flumes are definitely the best part, they're probably the best slides we've ever been on together, they're both very long and fast. It was also nice and warm inside despite being January and very chilly outside. Overall it's a fantastic place to come swimming with the family, it would be 5 stars although some of lockers were damaged and there are n't many family changing cubicles so you have to queue up and wait for one to become available. The price was also very reasonable, only 15 for both of us, so I'd definitely recommend you visit if you're looking for a fun place to go swimming with the family.",1,i just went swimming here for the first time with my daughter we had lots of fun it is great pool with a good wave machine bubbles and two brilliant flumes the flumes are definitely the best part they are probably the best slides we have ever been on together they are both very long and fast it was also nice and warm inside despite being january and very chilly outside overall it is a fantastic place to come swimming with the family it would be stars although some of lockers were damaged and there are n t many family changing cubicles so you have to queue up and wait for one to become available the price was also very reasonable only for both of us so i would definitely recommend you visit if you are looking for a fun place to go swimming with the family,went swimming first time daughter lot fun great pool good wave machine bubble two brilliant flume flume definitely best part probably best slide ever together long fast also nice warm inside despite january chilly outside overall fantastic place come swimming family would star although locker damaged n t many family changing cubicle queue wait one become available price also reasonable u would definitely recommend visit looking fun place go swimming family

"Arrived at 8 Friday, very busy night. Ordered food and drinks at the bar, no queueing( get your table number before ordering food). Choice of cask ale, unlike so many large pubs going over to cider( Happy days if you like cider). Food came in good time, chicken jalfrezi curry, rice, soft naan crispy poppadums plus chicken with a dip and chips.. chips could have been warmer but that was the only snag. The same eating experience could be had by visiting the ready meal section of a supermarket, heating it up at home with your own choice of music / TV. You still have to wash up. It's less fun, and cask ale tastes far better than cans or bottles. Drinks ordered on the app came super quick! Overall, it was a happy night for us. Amber Rooms is a big place, and we were lucky to get a seat. Very popular with students. Curry plus a pint on a Friday and many scrumy snack choices for under 6 why would n't it be.

"Out to eat with a friend. Saw the this place and thought we'd gamble it with the bad reviews. Sadly it lived up to them. Order was taken quick enough, but the clerk did n't seem to have much knowledge or advice about the menu. Took a while for the food to be prepared, so I would n't call this fast food in anyway.

"Lovely place with a big selection of food. We ordered the slider meals and they were much larger than expected. Portion sizes are great, flavours are so nice but one thing, everything seems to be over cooked. I could barely eat my fried chicken burger because it was so dry. If cooked well, they would have been perfect.",1,lovely place with a big selection of food we ordered the slider meals and they were much larger than expected portion sizes are great flavours are so nice but one thing everything seems to be over cooked i could barely eat my fried chicken burger because it was so dry if cooked well they would have been perfect,lovely place big selection food ordered slider meal much larger expected portion size great flavour nice one thing everything seems cooked could barely eat fried chicken burger dry cooked well would perfect
"It overpriced for what you actually get I I ordered garlic mushrooms with cheese, which I thought they would be breaded mushrooms, because that what most takeaways sell Also, who would want mushrooms ? Fried with cheese poured over ? And who would want to sell that if you own a takeaway or a food place you would n’t want to sell horrible food also it add 4 on here but got there there was a sticker over the price and they wrote 6 Also, I got some cookie dough what was meant to be 5 they charge 7 and I got banana waffle what was more expensive than it says on here as well I paid 18 for all this and none of it was worth it the waffle taste like that horrible taste ovens have when you do n’t clean a burnt taste and the only reason I ordered this food is because it did n’t have the food what I wanted. They said they did n’t sell that anymore so most of the things on the menu what you see on Google they do n’t really sell and the only reason I go there because there open around mine, but I wo n’t be going there again. I fuming. I have to pay for crap I did n’t eat I thought there no point asking for my money back as they are sometimes very rude and you give me a fake 5 for change I would n’t go there, unless you are starving, and you have no other options also I want to add when I got the food it was stapled show the bag it was like they did n’t want me to look in it until I got home ?

The food was not great at all. I ordered curry chicken with white rice, salad and coleslaw. The rice was extremely dry as if it had been burnt left out for ages on the side. The potatoes in the curry were barely cooked and the chicken was mediocre. I asked for fresh rice and it was just as bad. I did n’t finish my meal and left hungry. The coleslaw was good though.

Going on recommendations from over a year ago I booked. The service was good no complaints there but the food was very sub standard. The starters were ok and the crispy duck was fine. However cutting it up directly outside a toilet is a no no! This I never knew about until I got home and was told. If I had known it would have been sent back.

"Totally disappointed. I hired out the function room for my little one first birthday. On arrival to set up decorations, I found the room had n’t been cleaned and to be quite brutal-messy. There was tinsel and a coat hanger on the floor, bits and food droppings in the carpet, sticky and dirty tables not cleaned and left over balloons hanging from a previous party. I fully expected the room to be cleaned and tidy for booking. Why would a function room not be cleaned down and ready for the next party ?! I asked the 1 member of staff working why the room had n’t been cleaned and he could n’t answer why. He also did n’t have a hoover to at least get rid of the food droppings. I then asked if the heating could be turned on as it was cold. I was advised the radiators did n’t work. How is this acceptable when January is exceptionally cold and not have working radiators. When I had booked this venue I asked if the upstairs bar would be open, to which I was told yes, pending staffing. A few days prior I was told the bar would be open but again another issue on the day, only 1 staff member working on the downstairs bar. Later on someone else did arrive to open the upstairs bar but had to leave. I do n’t expect party guests to keep going up and down the stairs to fetch drinks. A big issue for a 1st birthday party was having no baby change facilities. This should of been stated at the time of booking. I would assume in 2024 baby change & disabled facilities are important and mandatory. I can not comment on the food here as luckily we took our own.

"Been going to this pub for years because the live entertainment is really good. Went there tonight for a few drinks with a friend and the old woman with blonde hair, glasses and tattoos was so rude! We went to the side bar which was totally empty, ordered our drinks and started enjoying our night. She rudely interrupted and said the bar would be getting busy, to which I replied I know, it not my first time here and we would move when it happens. She then aggressively said she would get the manager to move me away from the bar when there was no need. This caused further issues between myself and the barmaid. I very strongly suggest not to hire people like this at an establishment where dealing with customers is your main job. Her people skills are non-existent and is enough to put anyone off from coming back. Rude, obnoxious and self-entitled are the perfect words to describe this woman.",0,been going to this pub for years because the live entertainment is really good went there tonight for a few drinks with a friend and the old woman with blonde hair glasses and tattoos was so rude we went to the side bar which was totally empty ordered our drinks and started enjoying our night she rudely interrupted and said the bar would be getting busy to which i replied i know it not my first time here and we would move when it happens she then aggressively said she would get the manager to move me away from the bar when there was no need this caused further issues between myself and the barmaid i very strongly suggest not to hire people like this at an establishment where dealing with customers is your main job her people skills are non existent and is enough to put anyone off from coming back rude obnoxious and self entitled are the perfect words to describe this woman,going pub year live entertainment really good went tonight drink friend old woman blonde hair glass tattoo rude went side bar totally empty ordered drink started enjoying night rudely interrupted said bar would getting busy replied know not first time would move happens aggressively said would get manager move away bar no need caused issue barmaid strongly suggest not hire people like establishment dealing customer main job people skill non existent enough put anyone coming back rude obnoxious self entitled perfect word describe woman

"What a find. I had not heard of this brand before my son booked 4 of us into supper here. Nice buzz and busyness for a Sunday night. Loved the quirky decor. Very grand building as in the radiation part of an old Victorian hospital. The little sign outside has no indication of what a fab place you find inside. We had cocktails, drinks, starters and mains. First world problem, I know, but mildly disappointed W the red wine list... I like a good Pinot Noir, struggled to find a red to order. Not sure if my sea bass was meant to be quite so drowned in so much olive oil. I ate the food which was delicious, and left the oil. The other 3 had steaks which they devoured. Loved the wilted spinach but not so keen on the wilted rocket which would have been better left off the plate. Will definitely come again. Quibbles W the food are overtaken by the place itself.

"This TGI Fridays in Telford provided a consistently enjoyable dining experience. As a fan of American cuisine, I found their menu to be diverse and satisfying. From the moment I walked in, the energetic and lively atmosphere immediately set the tone for a fun dining experience. The staff at TGI Fridays were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit. Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours. However, the staff did their best to manage the crowd efficiently and keep waiting times to a minimum. Nevertheless, it's advisable to book a table in advance to avoid any potential delays.

"I've visited here before and had mixed experiences however this time it was rather pleasant. The room was clean and tidy( although a little worn and dated) but for what we paid for a night stay, we really could n't grumble. As it was a Bank Holiday the reception area was constantly busy and we had to queue for keys. No biggie though, just bear that in mind if you've little ones in tow. A key drop off box would be handy to save queuing to check out.

"Been to this place a couple of times now. The first pizza was pretty good. Thin, crispy and tasty but just lacked a little cheese. Overall quite good.

"Second visit in a few months, I must say it was a different eating experience this evening, we arrived for the early bird buffet and were pleasantly surprised. Apologies for the pictures. I opted for an eclectic mix to get a full taste experience. Things to note are the regular change out of food, with it being Aller serving trays you do have a higher turn over and this was reflected in the temp and texture. One unfortunate let down was the cracked plate, a real turn of for me second only to bent cutlery. However as an all you can eat experience it ticks the boxes at reasonably priced depending on the time. Cheap and cheerful with a good standard of choice and quality. Staff are friendly and general service was ok.

"If honest I found this petrol station quite a stressful experience. Nothing worse than needing to use the toilet and refuel ya van when you find there are two entrances right by each other and your hanging out the forecourt blocking the road as a driver decides to divert to your nearest pump, rather than one they are lined up for. Walking in the store seemed nice and clean, but the service to pay for fuel and give the vehicle registration left the cashier looking confused.. Not sure what's confusing about pressing a few buttons, but each to their own. Not sure if or when I'll next be working in area but may have to look for a different better laid out BP forecourt as hanging on to the highway whilst waiting to fuel is n't good for disabled passerby or traffic.",0,if honest i found this petrol station quite a stressful experience nothing worse than needing to use the toilet and refuel ya van when you find there are two entrances right by each other and your hanging out the forecourt blocking the road as a driver decides to divert to your nearest pump rather than one they are lined up for walking in the store seemed nice and clean but the service to pay for fuel and give the vehicle registration left the cashier looking confused not sure what is confusing about pressing a few buttons but each to their own not sure if or when i will next be working in area but may have to look for a different better laid out bp forecourt as hanging on to the highway whilst waiting to fuel is n t good for disabled passerby or traffic,honest found petrol station quite stressful experience nothing worse needing use toilet refuel ya van find two entrance right hanging forecourt blocking road driver decides divert nearest pump rather one lined walking store seemed nice clean service pay fuel give vehicle registration left cashier looking confused not sure confusing pressing button not sure next working area may look different better laid bp forecourt hanging highway whilst waiting fuel n t good disabled passerby traffic
"We visited the Brixton branch for tacos priced at 2 each. Despite expecting them to be small, the disappointment came from their lack of flavor, blandness, and being very cold. The vibrant decor did n't reflect in the food. The proteins were tasteless and cold, the tortilla dry, even with added hot sauce. The saving grace was a complimentary small margarita for signing up to their mailing list. My friend enjoyed the fact that the fries were crispy. On a Friday evening, we were initially surprised by the low turnout. However, after trying the food, the lack of crowds did n't come as a surprise anymore.",0,we visited the brixton branch for tacos priced at each despite expecting them to be small the disappointment came from their lack of flavor blandness and being very cold the vibrant decor did n t reflect in the food the proteins were tasteless and cold the tortilla dry even with added hot sauce the saving grace was a complimentary small margarita for signing up to their mailing list my friend enjoyed the fact that the fries were crispy on a friday evening we were initially surprised by the low turnout however after trying the food the lack of crowds did n t come as a surprise anymore,visited brixton branch taco priced despite expecting small disappointment came lack flavor blandness cold vibrant decor n t reflect food protein tasteless cold tortilla dry even added hot sauce saving grace complimentary small margarita signing mailing list friend enjoyed fact fry crispy friday evening initially surprised low turnout however trying food lack crowd n t come surprise anymore

"We had a horrible experience here!! The order taking process was a mess, the barista had no clue what he was doing and had to get assistance from another member. The indoor seating area was so filthy and aged that I would not step a foot again there. The kachori looked dead and tasteless, threw away most of it and the samosa was below average.

"Such a shame was expecting something fantastic. I ordered the lasagne sadly what I got was n't lasagne. I have attached photos of how it arrived. I have not removed a beautiful lasagne topping as you would expect there simply was n't one. Nor have I mixed it up its genuinely how it arrived. It was n't sheets of lasagne, mince and beshmal sauce topped with melted cheese. It was simply mushed up pasta sheets and mince with burnt corners and hard over done bits of pasta. It was just about edible but a massive shame not particularly the most flavoursome either. It was very basic. I was expecting a lot more in terms of presentation and quality the reviews I've seen have heard fantastic things about this place but this was a massive disappointment. I never leave negative feedback and this is n't. It's simply an honest review of what I was given.

"Great value for money, tasty food and amazing customer experience. My wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order, and the options become quite limited wherever we go. The chef was very thorough and came to the table to discuss the options. We ended up getting the vegetable biryani. For myself, I had the crispy fried vegetable momos( not gluten free by the way). They were spicy and delicious. Came with a sour cream sauce and a kind of sweet chilly sauce. One thing I would highly suggest is to have halal chicken options. There are a lot of Muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses, but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff. Would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal.

An unusual conversion of what I believe was an old mill into a hotel. The reception and catering are on the top floor with the accommodation on two lower floors. Room was up to standard and I appreciated the tea / coffee making kit as it was wet and gloomy over my stay. The evening food menu was not very wide but my pizza was perfectly fine. The Continental breakfast was very good. The only downside for me was the peculiar car parking arrangements. The entrance to the hotel is basically in a pay and display car park so I had to feed a meter with 90 minutes credit in the afternoon and skedaddle early in the morning to avoid paying any more! For once probably best to be a pedestrian.,1,an unusual conversion of what i believe was an old mill into a hotel the reception and catering are on the top floor with the accommodation on two lower floors room was up to standard and i appreciated the tea coffee making kit as it was wet and gloomy over my stay the evening food menu was not very wide but my pizza was perfectly fine the continental breakfast was very good the only downside for me was the peculiar car parking arrangements the entrance to the hotel is basically in a pay and display car park so i had to feed a meter with minutes credit in the afternoon and skedaddle early in the morning to avoid paying any more for once probably best to be a pedestrian,unusual conversion believe old mill hotel reception catering top floor accommodation two lower floor room standard appreciated tea coffee making kit wet gloomy stay evening food menu not wide pizza perfectly fine continental breakfast good downside peculiar car parking arrangement entrance hotel basically pay display car park feed meter minute credit afternoon skedaddle early morning avoid paying probably best pedestrian

"Came in here for our evening meal. Most that we chose from the menu was not available!! So that was disappointing, then took a while to order as we had to keep Anyway, we got there in the end. I had a strawberry and lime cider, which is always well tasty here, my partner prefers tea, so she had a refillable cup Food was ready quite quickly, as there were only locals drinking. The food was lovely, tasty, very hot and on a hot plate too Though our table was so messy when we got to it, had to ask the staff to clean it for us.

"We popped in to experience London cinema as well and did not regret at all. The chairs are comfy plus double chairs were available in the last row. Screen 4 is tiny as you can see on the video but it gives it a familiar feeling which we liked. The small tables next to the seats make it super comfy for popcorn and drink, not really if you plan to eat your pizza there.

"Honestly, the place just looked uncared for. Walking in the front there was no visible timetable, you had to wander over to concessions and await a timed board to hit the movie you wanted to see. Worse, three times I went by in my weeks in Edinburgh, the right shutter was kept shut. One can only guess if this is mechanical failure or just lack of trying at this point.

A few wins later I feel something hit my head and someone had either threw or spit or put chewing gum in my hair. It was disgusting, horrible and deeply upsetting. The security guard on that floor was no help and walked off when i was in corner upset what so ever he just stood there after my partner told him what happened and said nothing. I was in tears at this point and ended up going all the way down and back to entrance. The security guards on the door were amazing and really lovely to me and did what they could to help and comfort me. In the end the medic had to cut it out of my hair and luckily it was n't noticeable afterwards. I could n't be more grateful for the security and medic on the entrance for helping me and for being very understanding and doing what they can to try and find who did it.

"First time visitors from the US. The atmosphere was nice. The food was honestly so good. I tried the Mac & cheese dish and it was top notch. The service was ok. To be fair, I think for this night they may have been a bit understaffed. There was a large party in the back and we did n't see our waitress much after our food came. I think the poor thing was running around helping in the back. I only mention it because I do n't know if this was a one time occurrence or if it's common, here, but they were BUSY, not just sitting around ignoring us. Our bill was somehow lost as well. We patiently waited, understanding that they were obviously getting slammed with customers, and we mentioned nothing, and still the girl who came over to find / settle our bill insisted on taking drinks off of our bill for the wait, which was so very kind of her.

"We went for dinner booked online but we decided to go earlier. The restaurant was technically empty even on the 23rd of December. But thanks to it, the food and drinks were served very quickly and the waiters took care of us well. We had scallops and sweet potato fries for appetizers and sides first, beef tacos and chicken quesadilla for the main, and the churros for dessert. Everything was so tasty and the portion was huge which I recommend sharing with friends or family. However I got food poisoning from the scallops, I felt my stomach was weird after eating at first, and then I was throwing up after approximately 3 hours of eating until the next morning. I had a high fever and my throat hurt the next few days( probably I got norovirus). my friend was completely fine so I guess my stomach is sensitive.

"great taste. We ordered Asun, plantain, sharwama, fish, yam and plantain. The sauce that came in the yam is soooo good. We requested for more and the waiter graciously gave us. We only had issue with the size of the fish. The large fish was approximate to the size of the regular in another restaurant.

"I have been coming here for breakfast almost three or more times a week for 6 months, the breakfasts are always of a good standard and usually sent out in a timely manner. The menu has recently had an updated price which I find absolutely ridiculous, you now charge extra for absolutely everything ? In the last few days I had eggs Benedict with extra bacon and you charge for one slice of bacon ? This is unbelievable considering a pack of bacon is about 2. For 2 breakfasts with drinks( you always allowed the speciality hot chocolate onto the added drink but now you do n’t allow this ? Even charging me full price for coffee with a syrup) it was 50 for this with 2 smoothies ? Which cost per smoothie even though supplier sells them at each. Previously we could eat a good breakfast in here with 2 decent drinks for just shy of 30( still expensive for Doncaster but we always paid happily due to quality) now I feel this rise in price does n’t reflect the current state of people living standards, making the place feel pretentious and only about making more money. The average UK airport full English price is in 2024, yet you are charging in Doncaster, unbelievably ridiculous.

"Ordered a tawa for 4 Tawa usually contains the following items, 4 chicken tikka, 4 lamb chops, 2 chicken sheekh kebabs, 2 meat sheekh kebabs, 4 fish pakora, 4 chicken wings, 1 meat curry, 1 veg curry, 2 naan, 2 roti and chips.. Also separate salad and sauces We exchanged the veg curry for a chicken curry instead by paying a few pounds extra, so we had a meat and chicken curry on the tawa instead. Lamb chops were very enjoyable, good taste n flavour to them, likewise the sheekh kebabs especially the chicken ones, very meaty and the right amount of spice level to them. Both curries were tasty, meat was nice n tender. Unfortunately the same ca n't be said about the chicken tikka and fish pakora. The tikka was bland and tasteless in my opinion and the fish was a flop.. The service provided by the young kid with the glasses was top, sorry did n't get his name.

"We order from here a lot, always from their app. I would say at least once a month. And most of the time it's in acceptable or even good condition. Only 1 time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft, all the other times it was warm. Even though we are only a 5 minute drive away( but do n't drive). On one occasion, I found a hair and called to complain. I was called a liar and when I asked to be put through to a manager I was told no manager was in but he'd leave a message. I never got a call back. Every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it, they put tandoori chicken on it. On their menu they have 4 different kinds of chicken, including plain. Logically, if it does n't mention what kind it is, you'd assume it means plain. We called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told "" of course! We'd never do otherwise "". Last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it! It's so strong tasting, it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza. We called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it's our fault that we did n't know that chicken means tandoori chicken. I asked if they can at least change the menu so it's obvious you're not getting plain chicken, but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid. According to the reviews on Just Eat, I am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description. This time I was apparently speaking to a shift manager, who clearly knows nothing about customer service. He was incredibly rude and spoke over me. I asked to speak to the store manager and was told they were n't in( on a Friday evening). I asked to leave a message to be called back and yes you guessed it, that call never came. Rude, disrespectful and argumentative.",0,we order from here a lot always from their app i would say at least once a month and most of the time it is in acceptable or even good condition only time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft all the other times it was warm even though we are only a minute drive away but do n t drive on one occasion i found a hair and called to complain i was called a liar and when i asked to be put through to a manager i was told no manager was in but he would leave a message i never got a call back every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it they put tandoori chicken on it on their menu they have different kinds of chicken including plain logically if it does n t mention what kind it is you would assume it means plain we called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told of course we would never do otherwise last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it it is so strong tasting it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza we called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it is our fault that we did n t know that chicken means tandoori chicken i asked if they can at least change the menu so it is obvious you are not getting plain chicken but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid according to the reviews on just eat i am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description this time i was apparently speaking to a shift manager who clearly knows nothing about customer service he was incredibly rude and spoke over me i asked to speak to the store manager and was told they were n t in on a friday evening i asked to leave a message to be called back and yes you guessed it that call never came rude disrespectful and argumentative,order lot always app would say least month time acceptable even good condition time hot cheese still soft time warm even though minute drive away n t drive one occasion found hair called complain called liar asked put manager told no manager would leave message never got call back every single time ordered pizza chicken put tandoori chicken menu different kind chicken including plain logically n t mention kind would assume mean plain called month ago check pizza would plain chicken told course would never otherwise last week got chicken pizza surprise surprise put tandoori chicken strong tasting completely change taste whole pizza called complain told pizza come tandoori chicken mentioned order fault n t know chicken mean tandoori chicken asked least change menu obvious not getting plain chicken told no customer complained obviously complaint invalid according review eat not one unhappy misleading description time apparently speaking shift manager clearly know nothing customer service incredibly rude spoke asked speak store manager told n t friday evening asked leave message called back yes guessed call never came rude disrespectful argumentative

"This was a solid restaurant to eat in at, backed by strong lights alongside images and messages on frames! It was comfortable to sit on the leather that is accompanied by a table, after ordering on the machine then waiting at the counter, which displays the options clearly and has facilities like the napkins I picked up. My Zinger Burger, chips and Robinson drink were all delicious, which I ate in a clean area before discarding my waste in an appropriately sized bin! The staff could have sorted out this restaurant better though since the machine did not print order receipts and they were careless bagging my drink, causing it to spill on some of the food. I went here again and waited 10 minutes for 2 Hot Wings, yet the staff were considerate in giving me 6 ones that tasted piping fresh.",1,this was a solid restaurant to eat in at backed by strong lights alongside images and messages on frames it was comfortable to sit on the leather that is accompanied by a table after ordering on the machine then waiting at the counter which displays the options clearly and has facilities like the napkins i picked up my zinger burger chips and robinson drink were all delicious which i ate in a clean area before discarding my waste in an appropriately sized bin the staff could have sorted out this restaurant better though since the machine did not print order receipts and they were careless bagging my drink causing it to spill on some of the food i went here again and waited minutes for hot wings yet the staff were considerate in giving me ones that tasted piping fresh,solid restaurant eat backed strong light alongside image message frame comfortable sit leather accompanied table ordering machine waiting counter display option clearly facility like napkin picked zinger burger chip robinson drink delicious ate clean area discarding waste appropriately sized bin staff could sorted restaurant better though since machine not print order receipt careless bagging drink causing spill food went waited minute hot wing yet staff considerate giving one tasted piping fresh

"Visited this harbour during the Summer and what a beautiful place it was. The place was bustling with life and it's a great place for families or travelling on your lonesome.

"Been here many times and this review should be 5 stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ? The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of “ scruffy ” experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.",0,been here many times and this review should be stars however today as i am writing this review i have not just taken into consideration the product coffee but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n t it the coffee from costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served stars for this today it was busy in this branch of costa vision retail park hartlepool and staff seemed very pushed for the duration i was there this obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves the coffee machines were dirty the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around along with it being very dirty for the customers to see pictures attached to the review interestingly the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout my question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out the staff were polite and accommodating and i have found this on every visit to this branch of costa so kudos to the team there despite today visit being a kind of scruffy experience with costa i will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings perhaps costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further,many time review star however today writing review not taken consideration product coffee also taken consideration messy workplace staff working give true review reflection visit review supposed n t coffee costa everywhere go know expecting get served star today busy branch costa vision retail park hartlepool staff seemed pushed duration obviously led corner cut term cleanliness floor coffee machine coffee machine dirty floor unhygienic behind counter brush thing laid around along dirty customer see picture attached review interestingly steamer milk wiped use everyone no steam blown pipe expel milk may gotten spout question would someone dairy allergy spout used serving someone normal milk expelled normal milk drink surely clean short blast steam use would sort potential issue staff polite accommodating found every visit branch costa kudos team despite today visit kind scruffy experience costa back handy place conduct meeting perhaps costa invest staff resourcing known busy time customer experience heightened

"We visited the Ivy for a birthday celebration and were very disappointed. The server did not understand the menu and gave us wrong information regarding vegetarian options multiple times.

The afternoon tea was also below the usual standard as the sandwiches were dry / stale and the chocolate dessert was topped with canned whipped cream, followed by a whole pot of watery chocolate sauce. The other cakes were also underwhelming and it was no surprise the table next to us left their cakes uneaten.

"Overall for a first time we would give it out of 5. Quiet midweek night out for 6 of us and pretty empty but inside is nice and inviting. The 2 staff that was on were nice friendly and happy to help with questions so 5 stars with service. Used a coupon for a free garlic bread which was pretty small so we got a small bit each but was average taste but free so ca n't complain on that. Drinks. Cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe. Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7. I would visit again but with not such a big group due to costs but we still enjoyed the evening and enjoyable just not fantastic.

Have stayed at this Novotel close to 10 times in the past 1 year and the primary reason for my preference is the location as it is right at the center of the town and many many great food options nearby. The overall service is very good and the staff of the hotel is also very friendly. The rooms are quiet and well furnished but the sofas in all the rooms were pretty dated and used. The fitness room is pretty standard and the pool sauna is also nice to have. Would recommend but is overall a mid ranged costing option in Reading center.,1,have stayed at this novotel close to times in the past year and the primary reason for my preference is the location as it is right at the center of the town and many many great food options nearby the overall service is very good and the staff of the hotel is also very friendly the rooms are quiet and well furnished but the sofas in all the rooms were pretty dated and used the fitness room is pretty standard and the pool sauna is also nice to have would recommend but is overall a mid ranged costing option in reading center,stayed novotel close time past year primary reason preference location right center town many many great food option nearby overall service good staff hotel also friendly room quiet well furnished sofa room pretty dated used fitness room pretty standard pool sauna also nice would recommend overall mid ranged costing option reading center
"Very unassuming little place, tucked away next to a pan shop, juice stall and snacks shop. Service was quick both the times we ate here, and the food was excellent. They have a VAST menu on one side wall. Other amenities( restroom for customers, washbasin) as well as seating area is pretty limited. But you go here for the great taste of their food, not to sit down for a leisurely meal. Where else will you get a Rava Masala Pav Bhaji Paneer Supreme Dosa, along with your regular Dahi Puri and Gobi Paneer Manchurian ? Do n’t forget to get a masala pan( from the pan shop) after your meal!",1,very unassuming little place tucked away next to a pan shop juice stall and snacks shop service was quick both the times we ate here and the food was excellent they have a vast menu on one side wall other amenities restroom for customers washbasin as well as seating area is pretty limited but you go here for the great taste of their food not to sit down for a leisurely meal where else will you get a rava masala pav bhaji paneer supreme dosa along with your regular dahi puri and gobi paneer manchurian do n t forget to get a masala pan from the pan shop after your meal,unassuming little place tucked away next pan shop juice stall snack shop service quick time ate food excellent vast menu one side wall amenity restroom customer washbasin well seating area pretty limited go great taste food not sit leisurely meal else get rava masala pav bhaji paneer supreme dosa along regular dahi puri gobi paneer manchurian n t forget get masala pan pan shop meal

"Well McDonalds Food is always tasty. I think the electronic ordering stations inside the store are a great idea, but I think you need to add another one more atleast to make it run more efficiently especially at lunchtimes, and other busy times, because when people have a short time to get food within their break times from work, it can be very frustrating.

"The staff are fantastic, so friendly and welcoming, and had a bit of a laugh and joke around with us, including joking around with my step daughters as they were getting their pick and mix. This helped to make the evening a bit more fun and enjoyable. Our film was on screen 3, I think it was. It was fine, the screen was large and sound was good. We sat towards the back in the middle, so viewing angles were great. The negative, though, were the seats, which were a little uncomfortable, especially as it got toward the end of the film. Because of this, I've removed a star.

"Came here to celebrate something special. Got in at 7 pm, first drink came at which was fine. Then came the wait. We complained then the meal got served along with the second drink after we said we were leaving. The wait was n’t great, no one explained anything until we complained. After we finished eating the very bland food, we waited another 15 minutes before our tables got cleared. This was after the waiter passed our table several times without paying any attention to us. We had already ordered dessert along with the main meal … but we still had to wait again after our main dishes had been cleared to even get that. Not sure I ever be back after this encounter that has left me feeling annoyed by everything( the service & the food).

"Glen Hansard nothing wrong with Glen or Ticketmaster-this is for the venue operation or event-sec staff-they caused issues by stopping patrons re-entering the concert standing area( after using the lavatories, phone calls or purchasing drinks within the rest of the venue grounds).

"Their food is always hit and miss. I love going there for breakfast after I've had an odd shift at work. Preps me ready for the day ahead. I always used to have their vegetarian breakfast wraps, but I had to stop ordering them because they started looking like someone had thrown the wrap around the kitchen before making it. Plus they do n't melt the cheese and because its like a slice of cheddar when you bite into it its a weird sensation, you get all the hot from the hash browns etc then you reach this cold mush. It is n't great. However, I have now found the sausage muffins, and they are beautiful. For less than 5 I can get a quorn muffin, with an unlimited hot drink and hash brown! Honestly it is such an amazing deal. I would highly recommend, especially if you like a maccys breakfast, I'd go to butlers Bell over maccys any day of the week. The staff are all so lovely.

"My dining experience left me slightly disappointed as the meal quantity fell short of my expectations. Despite the speedy preparation, the portion size failed to match that of other McDonald outlets in the city. The table untidiness further added to the less-than-ideal atmosphere. Although, it's in the city center which makes it a perfectly accessible spot for burger enthusiasts. However, the familiar delight of McDonald taste remained consistently excellent, as expected. The flavors and quality of the food continue to be a commendable aspect, providing a satisfying culinary experience. While the quantity and tidiness aspects may have left room for improvement, the unwavering taste quality reaffirms McDonald commitment to delivering a consistently delicious dining experience. Despite the minor shortcomings, the familiar and delightful taste ensures that McDonald remains a reliable choice for those seeking a flavorful and enjoyable meal.",0,my dining experience left me slightly disappointed as the meal quantity fell short of my expectations despite the speedy preparation the portion size failed to match that of other mcdonald outlets in the city the table untidiness further added to the less than ideal atmosphere although it is in the city center which makes it a perfectly accessible spot for burger enthusiasts however the familiar delight of mcdonald taste remained consistently excellent as expected the flavors and quality of the food continue to be a commendable aspect providing a satisfying culinary experience while the quantity and tidiness aspects may have left room for improvement the unwavering taste quality reaffirms mcdonald commitment to delivering a consistently delicious dining experience despite the minor shortcomings the familiar and delightful taste ensures that mcdonald remains a reliable choice for those seeking a flavorful and enjoyable meal,dining experience left slightly disappointed meal quantity fell short expectation despite speedy preparation portion size failed match mcdonald outlet city table untidiness added less ideal atmosphere although city center make perfectly accessible spot burger enthusiast however familiar delight mcdonald taste remained consistently excellent expected flavor quality food continue commendable aspect providing satisfying culinary experience quantity tidiness aspect may left room improvement unwavering taste quality reaffirms mcdonald commitment delivering consistently delicious dining experience despite minor shortcoming familiar delightful taste ensures mcdonald remains reliable choice seeking flavorful enjoyable meal

"This venue has been a welcome addition to the otherwise bland and limited offering that Shrewsbury has to offer. A packed and vibrant atmosphere with attentive & friendly staff clearly please couples, groups of friends and family patrons. It has always been busy when we have dined here and booking( especially at the weekends) is a must. The burgers are OK but do not rival those of the Beefy Boys venue also in town. The spicy chicken wings are seriously hot and this may well have affected my taste buds and enjoyment of the burger, but my overall impression was that it was pretty standard in nature. Good drinks menu and calorie rich deserts make for an indulgent and satisfying end to what was a pleasant trip to this popular destination restaurant.

I then saw the cashier take off the price tag and threw it away. I told my daughter what happened and she went to the cashier to say she had overcharged me. Her response was "" oh did I ? "".

"I used to belong to the Stratford Picture House when it was a clean, nice place and the benefits were good. I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed( so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond.

"Interesting place. Food was nice, though the choices were a little limited for my tastes. The organisation and service was excellent and ca n't be faulted at all, fantastic staff all round. Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it.

"Occassion: Saturday Brunch Pax: 2 We went out to try this new coffee shop jist next to Crawley Mall. Ambience: Large Space and It was almost full coz a Sunny Saturday. We somehow manage to find a corner table. Nice Ambience, noisy on weekend but enjoyable during other days. You have take away and dine in options. Some of the dishes are served to you at ur table and quick items like ur coffee and other ready to eats are to be taken by you. Service: Quick service and good baristas. Food: I had the best Cortado so far, amazing taste. By curiosity I always watch the baristas make my coffee but, this was was different, there was no hurry and the espresso was well blended with a whisk before they poured the milk in, took the bitterness and a smooth cortado for us. I was impressed. Now I am not going to Costa for my Cortado. The Cookies and Cream Brownie was not wow but good enuf with the coffee. Lots of options for bruch and breakfast, I am sure if u r dining for them it wo n’t be quick.

"Pretty trendy pizza place but was n’t amazed by it. The atmosphere was nice but very loud with fans going nonstop. The pizza itself was alright but not good enough to warrant a return trip here.

The service was slow but very friendly, I do n’t want to mark them down too much here because there were only two members of staff doing all the service for a full restaurant.

"This place is very busy & popular. Went there on a Sunday morning at about had to wait 25 mins for a table so had a coffee in the front. I got a table outside in a nice courtyard. Slow service but they were very busy. The food well, I would say it got a non theme. I had the Big Kiwi breakfast as I wanted as close to quality tasty traditional / Irish breakfast as I could get here. The bacon was streaky. I prefer back bacon as I do n’t want loads of fat. The sausage lacked taste. They had ciabatta which was very hard on the edges. Would have preferred some quality bread toasted but that just my preference. It probably just not the place for me.

"Unfortunate Birthday at Nando: Seeking a laid-back atmosphere for my New Year Eve birthday while I was feeling unwell, Nando seemed like the perfect choice — until our dinner plans turned into disappointment. The news of running out of whole chicken extended our wait to 30-40 minutes. Hoping to salvage the evening, we ordered chicken livers as a starter, priced at a hefty 9. To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness. Nando, charging a premium for mediocre dishes, wo n't cut it. What is happening to British hospitality ?

"My husband and I decided to pop in for a spontaneous lunch and were seated promptly upstairs. A very interesting and eclectic decor that keeps you looking around as you investigate more and more of the pictures and unique lighting fixtures, there a wonderful vibrant atmosphere with just the right level of noise from music and conversation. I decided to go for the Butchers Brunch with poached eggs, treacle-cured pork belly chop, two Cumberland sausages, smoked back bacon, house rostis, chorizo beans, buttered toasted sourdough and my husband had 6 American Pancakes with streaky bacon, blueberries and maple syrup. Everything was very tasty, all the pork products on my brunch were well cooked without being dry the pancakes were nice and fluffy. The Butches Brunch was a bit pork-heavy for my liking and could have used something to lighten it a little, perhaps grilled tomato or mushrooms to cut through all the meat and the pancakes could have the option of some yoghurt to enhance them, none the less we enjoyed our lunch very much and want to return for breakfasts or dinner soon.

Starters of lamb chops and chicken tikka were average, but the onion bhajis were really good. Mains were where things got really good. The lamb lababdaar was fantastic with a very good chicken tikka dish and saag paneer. Rice and naan were nice but the portions were a little on the small side.

"This cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around! Less than 6 per person, even when booking our tickets online. My husband and I went at the end of March. I have a disability, so arrived a little earlier to allow time to get from the nearby car park to the cinema, as there is no parking outside the building. The lift is quite hidden and easily missed. It was rather old looking, much like the rest of the cinema, and very, very slow going both up and down. Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small. Sadly, most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby, though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability I managed a 2hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting, which is good for me. Despite the few negative points, I will definitely come again, mainly due to how close it is to my home and the fact that it does n't cost us an arm and a leg!!",1,this cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around less than per person even when booking our tickets online my husband and i went at the end of march i have a disability so arrived a little earlier to allow time to get from the nearby car park to the cinema as there is no parking outside the building the lift is quite hidden and easily missed it was rather old looking much like the rest of the cinema and very very slow going both up and down anyone who does n t like being in a lift much will probably not like this one as it is also rather small sadly most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability i managed a hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting which is good for me despite the few negative points i will definitely come again mainly due to how close it is to my home and the fact that it does n t cost us an arm and a leg,cinema one cheapest cinema around less per person even booking ticket online husband went end march disability arrived little earlier allow time get nearby car park cinema no parking outside building lift quite hidden easily missed rather old looking much like rest cinema slow going anyone n t like lift much probably not like one also rather small sadly cinema decor look old rather shabby though seat smaller cinema quite comfortable despite disability managed hr screening without much discomfort fidgeting good despite negative point definitely come mainly due close home fact n t cost u arm leg

"I work near the place and always heard good things and when I pass it in the afternoon it smells divine. So after all these years my missus and I gave it a shot. We had a baby with us so we parked up outside and called it in, we get somewhat the same from our local Chinese which are common items so that's fine. 20 min wait which is great, especially since there was a steady stream of customers, always a few cars parked waiting. The price was good maybe slightly higher than our local but within the ball range. The special fired rice was great and so was the gravy and the missus loved hers. But we always get a portion of salt and pepper chips and me being a fatty chicken, I think it was strips. Sadly the range brings it down. Feels more like an after thought than a proper dish. It was fine though. A great take out overall and well priced.

"The added touch to this Wetherspoons is the quality and design of the building. Generally, you know what you will get from Wetherspoons, which is great value food and each of which you probably get the best choice from any chain in the country. But this one is different with it being in an old cinema and bingo hall, so it has retained the character from it heritage. We made a couple of changes from the actual meal items and were served as requested. A big breakfast for( held off on the eggs) and a Fiesta brunch at( extra sausage and bacon added). Tea and coffee at each where you get unlimited refills at this price just adds to the appeal and value. Nowhere in the UK gives such decent sized portions with quality food at those prices. I will happily go to Wetherspoons for breakfast any day of the week.",1,the added touch to this wetherspoons is the quality and design of the building generally you know what you will get from wetherspoons which is great value food and each of which you probably get the best choice from any chain in the country but this one is different with it being in an old cinema and bingo hall so it has retained the character from it heritage we made a couple of changes from the actual meal items and were served as requested a big breakfast for held off on the eggs and a fiesta brunch at extra sausage and bacon added tea and coffee at each where you get unlimited refills at this price just adds to the appeal and value nowhere in the uk gives such decent sized portions with quality food at those prices i will happily go to wetherspoons for breakfast any day of the week,added touch wetherspoons quality design building generally know get wetherspoons great value food probably get best choice chain country one different old cinema bingo hall retained character heritage made couple change actual meal item served requested big breakfast held egg fiesta brunch extra sausage bacon added tea coffee get unlimited refill price add appeal value nowhere uk give decent sized portion quality food price happily go wetherspoons breakfast day week

The staff are pleasant but the store is often filthy. Especially around the checkouts and customer toilets which are abhorrent. They are now on Deliveroo but do not bother to use them. They will simply cancel your order after about 30 minutes because they apparently do n’t want to honour the sales on the platforms they sign themselves up to. Really poor. Had family coming and wanted some extras and was low on time. This seemed so ideal but sadly it happened so many times now I wo n’t bother trying again. Get off Deliveroo if you not going to deliver.

"Entering as a walk in, the venue was very accommodating and were able to find a table for two very quickly. We were provided with drinks also very quickly which was very good service. The service was the highlight of this visit. The low rating is due to the food. We ordered a seafood vongole and a seafood risotto with a side of truffle fries and tenderstem broccoli. The brocoli and the fries were lovely but we were both deeply disappointed with our main dishes. Both were bland, lacked seasoning, and neither tasted of seafood. We found ourselves prioritising the brocoli and fries which was noted by the attentive staff. How a plate of clams and pasta can taste of nothing was beyond my imagination for such a highly rated restaurant.",0,entering as a walk in the venue was very accommodating and were able to find a table for two very quickly we were provided with drinks also very quickly which was very good service the service was the highlight of this visit the low rating is due to the food we ordered a seafood vongole and a seafood risotto with a side of truffle fries and tenderstem broccoli the brocoli and the fries were lovely but we were both deeply disappointed with our main dishes both were bland lacked seasoning and neither tasted of seafood we found ourselves prioritising the brocoli and fries which was noted by the attentive staff how a plate of clams and pasta can taste of nothing was beyond my imagination for such a highly rated restaurant,entering walk venue accommodating able find table two quickly provided drink also quickly good service service highlight visit low rating due food ordered seafood vongole seafood risotto side truffle fry tenderstem broccoli brocoli fry lovely deeply disappointed main dish bland lacked seasoning neither tasted seafood found prioritising brocoli fry noted attentive staff plate clam pasta taste nothing beyond imagination highly rated restaurant

"It was a working lunch, met a client and was lunchtime, so wanted something warming considering it was 2c outside … Found this place by chance whilst driving through; had to pay for parking so was annoyed-but this is sadly London I guess! Was greeted immediately and I knew what I wanted already. Had a Lamb Shish with rice but it was without asking served with a bowl of side salad, bulgar wheat, fresh pitta bread and the chilli sauce tasted splendid. The lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender, juicy and succulent as the last. The rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish( as opposed to just the pitta or chips) it was ‘ warming ’ and had a gentle, buttery taste. Interior was simple, yet beautiful; a modern and classic mixed look. There even a veiled prayer booth / section at the back; now you may not pray( or be of the Islamic faith) but the addition of such a room was thoughtful-and it blended in and added to the whole ambience.

Found this by accident but pleased we did. The museum is a former depot so its just as important as the collection within its walls. Surprisingly large collection of mainly local made buses which you can go on some of them. Although not from the area it was definitely a trip down memory lane. Easily spend a good couple of hours in there. Well worth a visit for any transport buff,1,found this by accident but pleased we did the museum is a former depot so its just as important as the collection within its walls surprisingly large collection of mainly local made buses which you can go on some of them although not from the area it was definitely a trip down memory lane easily spend a good couple of hours in there well worth a visit for any transport buff,found accident pleased museum former depot important collection within wall surprisingly large collection mainly local made bus go although not area definitely trip memory lane easily spend good couple hour well worth visit transport buff
"Chikaros, nestled in the heart of West Bromwich offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates. During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional. From the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality, it's clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences. Whether you're craving traditional favorites or eager to explore new culinary horizons, Chikaros is sure to delight your senses and leave you coming back for more.",1,chikaros nestled in the heart of west bromwich offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates during my recent visit i embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed upon entering the cozy ambiance of chikaros i was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff the menu boasting an array of enticing options immediately caught my attention from traditional classics to innovative creations there was something to please every taste bud i opted for the chef kebabish a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices each bite was a symphony of flavors showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs the tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes equally impressive was the classic parmesan a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at chikaros the crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese it was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more however despite the culinary delights i was disappointed to discover that chikaros does not accept card payments while this may not deter cash carrying patrons it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions it is a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless overall my experience at chikaros was nothing short of exceptional from the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality it is clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences whether you are craving traditional favorites or eager to explore new culinary horizons chikaros is sure to delight your senses and leave you coming back for more,chikaros nestled heart west bromwich offer tantalizing fusion flavor cater diverse palate recent visit embarked culinary journey left satisfied impressed upon entering cozy ambiance chikaros greeted aroma spice welcoming smile staff menu boasting array enticing option immediately caught attention traditional classic innovative creation something please every taste bud opted chef kebabish delightful combination succulent meat grilled perfection infused aromatic spice bite symphony flavor showcasing culinary expertise chef tender meat paired beautifully accompanying sauce creating harmonious blend sweet savory note equally impressive classic parmesan timeless favorite elevated new height chikaros crispy coating gave way tender chicken breast smothered rich marinara sauce gooey melted cheese comforting indulgence left craving however despite culinary delight disappointed discover chikaros not accept card payment may not deter cash carrying patron pose inconvenience accustomed convenience card transaction small hiccup otherwise stellar dining experience one worth noting nonetheless overall experience chikaros nothing short exceptional delectable dish warm hospitality clear establishment take pride delivering memorable dining experience whether craving traditional favorite eager explore new culinary horizon chikaros sure delight sens leave coming back

"The place is lovely. Lovely servers and lovely atmosphere, however, every time I happen to go in there, the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients. All times I have been, my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them. For example, my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie. When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances. For example, I'm lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options. I ended up asking for a hot chocolate instead and giving it to my partner who complained how it tasted like it had n't been mixed at all. For the prices, there is definitely room for improvement regarding the drinks and food. I'm disappointed to say the least.",0,the place is lovely lovely servers and lovely atmosphere however every time i happen to go in there the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients all times i have been my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them for example my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie when told they ca n t make my specific smoothie they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so i picked one of those a few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n t make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice at this point it has n t even reached peak hours on top of this there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n t fresh whatsoever i really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances for example i am lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options i ended up asking for a hot chocolate instead and giving it to my partner who complained how it tasted like it had n t been mixed at all for the prices there is definitely room for improvement regarding the drinks and food i am disappointed to say the least,place lovely lovely server lovely atmosphere however every time happen go range extremely limited lack ingredient time order declined numerous time not make example recent encounter involves trying order smoothie told ca n t make specific smoothie mentioned make smoothie option picked one minute later come back saying ca n t make smoothy ran juice point n t even reached peak hour top hardly cake display pastry n t fresh whatsoever really tried enjoy fact range limited make incredibly difficult accommodate people certain intolerance example lactose intolerant lactose free drink knowledge water no advertise alternative milk option ended asking hot chocolate instead giving partner complained tasted like n t mixed price definitely room improvement regarding drink food disappointed say least

Restaurant; Staff, as mentioned are excellent and very attentive. Food, whilst taste is OK, is nothing special and the menu for the evening meal is extremely limited. Portions are of good size.

"First time visit today-we will be coming back. The first waitress was quick to seat us with menus, which are pretty extensive. The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite. Although parking is a bit of an issue, particularly for those who are less able, we are looking forward to coming back again, and will likely recommend it.",1,first time visit today we will be coming back the first waitress was quick to seat us with menus which are pretty extensive the second waitress was a little too eager to take our order we had only just started looking through the menu but was happy to wait we eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream of which there is a vast choice of flavours a strawberry gelato milkshake and the brookie we were also given a taster plate of macarons these were far less favourable than our order the waitress was n t sure of the flavours but we guessed at x coffee which we did nt try as we dislike coffee x pistachio which did nt taste of anything and x strawberry which was quite nondescript just sweet as they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them we would be disappointed from what we tried all of them were prepared quickly and were delicious the brookie being a particular favourite although parking is a bit of an issue particularly for those who are less able we are looking forward to coming back again and will likely recommend it,first time visit today coming back first waitress quick seat u menu pretty extensive second waitress little eager take order started looking menu happy wait eventually settled choc chip cookie dough salted caramel ice cream vast choice flavour strawberry gelato milkshake brookie also given taster plate macarons far less favourable order waitress n t sure flavour guessed x coffee nt try dislike coffee x pistachio nt taste anything x strawberry quite nondescript sweet complimentary nt matter much paid box would disappointed tried prepared quickly delicious brookie particular favourite although parking bit issue particularly less able looking forward coming back likely recommend

"Really sad to post a 2 star review as we were really looking forward to eating here. Ordered a prawn curry, chicken korma, pilau rice and garlic naan. Rice was freezing cold( we live right next door so nothing to do with the journey home), naan had no flavour and had an awful texture. The chicken in the korma was on the bone and pink in the middle so could n't be eaten. I've given a 2 star as the prawn curry was nice and flavours in the sauce were fab. Lots of oil floating on top though. Ca n't pay by card in the restaurant which seems unusual in this day and age and also a pain because of having to walk to cash machine!

"The food was amazing. Both the pies and the fries were fresh made. The ambiance was lively and enjoyable, and the decoration is an experience in itself. However, our experience was definitely affected by our server. She was very rude, and repeatedly rushed us. We had just arrived, and as we were taking our coats off, she asked if we were ready to order. She then came again, not two minutes after that, and asked once again. By the third time, when we hurried to choose so as to not be pressured again, she quickly responded "" Thank God "" when we said we were ready. She then proceeded to ask us to leave, when she saw we had finished our food, but I guess she must not have noticed we still had our drinks. I would still go back! The place is located beautifully, and the food was good.

"Great restaurant and great service. One little hiccup, ordered a strawberry lassi. When they brought mango out, we said we ordered strawberry. The waitress tried to force it onto us and said we ordered mango, but one of us ca n't eat mango so we knew it was n't our mistake. This gave us a little disappointment in what brilliant service we got from the guys. Chicken wings was cooked just right, juicy, tasty, big and a very nice charcoal flavour. Liver starters, despite the liver having a rich taste to it it was yummy Lamb chops, missing that little something that we could n't out our finger on Family nan, light, fluffy great taste Curry, ok, chicken had a dry taste.

"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",1,went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with pizza hut in hayes i was pleasantly surprised the first thing i noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked the crust golden like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque caribbean beach perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect secondly the cheese was there usually i am second guessing myself wondering if i had accidentally clicked the extra dough option when ordering rather than extra cheese this time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency something that i wo n t deduct points for anyway having a few slices with a bit less cheese knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal the sauce was plenty ladled and because the pizza was n t overcooked the toppings were juicy and tender remember if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop i guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves or they just care about their customers all in all great experience,went whim ordered despite previous abysmal experience pizza hut hayes pleasantly surprised first thing noticed pizza not overcooked crust golden like soaking ray picturesque caribbean beach perfectly moist spongy one would expect secondly cheese usually second guessing wondering accidentally clicked extra dough option ordering rather extra cheese time visibly slid across surface pizza transit due sheer weight consistency something wo n t deduct point anyway slice bit less cheese knowing going reach absolutely coated came quite exciting almost tense ordeal sauce plenty ladled pizza n t overcooked topping juicy tender remember want pepperoni crisp buy shop guess time person preparing pizza connoisseur care customer great experience

"An amazing restaurant situated in Central MK. From stepping through the doors, Akasaka delivers-with a beautiful bar and pink cherry blossom trees. The staff and service was fantastic exemplary from start to finish. We had the Karage Chicken, Spicy Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki to start. The Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki were brilliant, but the Karage chicken a little disappointing. It was the crispiest chicken I have ever eaten, but it was n’t very flavoursome-even with the dip. We followed this with Beef Bibimbap and Salmon Bibimbap. Both of these were brilliant-the hot beef comes in a searing hot iron bowl and continues to sizzle the whole time you eating it! The flavour was fantastic and it was nice to be able to ‘ self sauce ’ to personal levels.

Maybe employ a cleaner for the toilets GDK as I would n’t like the food prepping staff to also be the people who clean the toilets.",1,foods always good and service to your table is fast staff are very polite and have a positive attitude ipswich and me and my misses very much enjoy our visits only issue i have is the toilets are always in a very poor state sadly and i feel this brings the place down maybe employ a cleaner for the toilets gdk as i would n t like the food prepping staff to also be the people who clean the toilets,food always good service table fast staff polite positive attitude ipswich miss much enjoy visit issue toilet always poor state sadly feel brings place maybe employ cleaner toilet gdk would n t like food prepping staff also people clean toilet

"The only vegan items are the hash browns, pizza and brownies unfounfately. Not vegan myself but a massive chain like this needs to start having more items on the menu. The lime can be long at peak time but staff are patient and helpful. Good for food on the go. Bottled Drinks are a little expensive... go else to get those, do n't buy with food.",0,the only vegan items are the hash browns pizza and brownies unfounfately not vegan myself but a massive chain like this needs to start having more items on the menu the lime can be long at peak time but staff are patient and helpful good for food on the go bottled drinks are a little expensive go else to get those do n t buy with food,vegan item hash brown pizza brownie unfounfately not vegan massive chain like need start item menu lime long peak time staff patient helpful good food go bottled drink little expensive go else get n t buy food

Speed of service is average. Ordered food on the McDonald app it took approximately 5min to come to my table. Then I ordered a latte and it took roughly the same time. My latte had a small hair in it which I removed. It was at the top of the cup. Asked for sugar and milk for my drink but I received no stirrer for putting it in. I used my empty fries box to stir my milk and sugar into my latte. So 2 star for this time.,0,speed of service is average ordered food on the mcdonald app it took approximately min to come to my table then i ordered a latte and it took roughly the same time my latte had a small hair in it which i removed it was at the top of the cup asked for sugar and milk for my drink but i received no stirrer for putting it in i used my empty fries box to stir my milk and sugar into my latte so star for this time,speed service average ordered food mcdonald app took approximately min come table ordered latte took roughly time latte small hair removed top cup asked sugar milk drink received no stirrer putting used empty fry box stir milk sugar latte star time
As a cathedral I give it 4 *. Not its fault really-it was a church given the status of a cathedral-so it does not have the grant stature of a cathedral building. But a lovely place to visit-has an excellent cafe-had an art / craft market on the day I visited. Has the standard from HMS Sheffield.,1,as a cathedral i give it not its fault really it was a church given the status of a cathedral so it does not have the grant stature of a cathedral building but a lovely place to visit has an excellent cafe had an art craft market on the day i visited has the standard from hms sheffield,cathedral give not fault really church given status cathedral not grant stature cathedral building lovely place visit excellent cafe art craft market day visited standard hm sheffield
"Where to start. Firstly our waitress was so bad. Uncaring and not customer focused, slow lady. She took our drink orders and then a lady behind the bar served the drinks to us. I told her that we are ready to make food order. She said it's not her responsibility, but amazingly kindly she came back from the bar and took our order. Where was our waitress at the same time ? Being bored with the other waitresses sort of. We were waiting long minutes and the food did n't arrive. I went to the bored waitresses to ask for my food. Because neither of them( 3) bothered to come to our table for 15 mins to ask if we need anything and the place was n't busy at all by that time. They looked at me with a surprise. Food ? You did n't order food. Indeed I did. The lady from bar turned up after serving a customer. She apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food. She offered our food on the house at this point. She kept on apologizing. She was an excellent employee and 5 * customer service from her! The waitresses still did n't bother. I think the team work is bad here. Why everything is relying on the chef lady ? The food was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed it. I left the place happily and would return, only because of the chef lady! Who apologised before we left again and I gave her a tip.",0,where to start firstly our waitress was so bad uncaring and not customer focused slow lady she took our drink orders and then a lady behind the bar served the drinks to us i told her that we are ready to make food order she said it is not her responsibility but amazingly kindly she came back from the bar and took our order where was our waitress at the same time being bored with the other waitresses sort of we were waiting long minutes and the food did n t arrive i went to the bored waitresses to ask for my food because neither of them bothered to come to our table for mins to ask if we need anything and the place was n t busy at all by that time they looked at me with a surprise food you did n t order food indeed i did the lady from bar turned up after serving a customer she apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food she offered our food on the house at this point she kept on apologizing she was an excellent employee and customer service from her the waitresses still did n t bother i think the team work is bad here why everything is relying on the chef lady the food was absolutely amazing i really enjoyed it i left the place happily and would return only because of the chef lady who apologised before we left again and i gave her a tip,start firstly waitress bad uncaring not customer focused slow lady took drink order lady behind bar served drink u told ready make food order said not responsibility amazingly kindly came back bar took order waitress time bored waitress sort waiting long minute food n t arrive went bored waitress ask food neither bothered come table min ask need anything place n t busy time looked surprise food n t order food indeed lady bar turned serving customer apologised rush making people order u forgot food offered food house point kept apologizing excellent employee customer service waitress still n t bother think team work bad everything relying chef lady food absolutely amazing really enjoyed left place happily would return chef lady apologised left gave tip
"been here twice and each time was amazing. there really is n’t much to criticise; food is amazing, service is great, atmosphere comfortable. however, we tried the jerk bbq chicken tenders and they were on the dry side, less than warm, and lacking flavour. fortunately, due to the superb quality of the rest of our meal it was easy to overlook this. thanks guys:)",1,been here twice and each time was amazing there really is n t much to criticise food is amazing service is great atmosphere comfortable however we tried the jerk bbq chicken tenders and they were on the dry side less than warm and lacking flavour fortunately due to the superb quality of the rest of our meal it was easy to overlook this thanks guys,twice time amazing really n t much criticise food amazing service great atmosphere comfortable however tried jerk bbq chicken tender dry side less warm lacking flavour fortunately due superb quality rest meal easy overlook thanks guy
"Went to a screening of Anatomy of a Fall here. Screen 1 is so grand and beautiful! Chairs are comfortable, space is big. The lobby is gorgeous too. Honestly the whole building is stunning and worth at least one visit. Only complaint is that the walls are so SO thin. During the film screening I could hear cars honking and beeping and ambulance sirens from the main road. Honestly it took me a minute to realise that the noise was n’t coming from the movie lol but when i did n’t i could n’t stop hearing it. It actually shocking how loud the sound were. Not sure why the main screen has n’t been sound proofed, can only speculate that it may be because it a grade II listed building. Not really that big of a deal though if you not an audiophile and also if you going to watch a loud marvel type blockbuster haha.",1,went to a screening of anatomy of a fall here screen is so grand and beautiful chairs are comfortable space is big the lobby is gorgeous too honestly the whole building is stunning and worth at least one visit only complaint is that the walls are so so thin during the film screening i could hear cars honking and beeping and ambulance sirens from the main road honestly it took me a minute to realise that the noise was n t coming from the movie lol but when i did n t i could n t stop hearing it it actually shocking how loud the sound were not sure why the main screen has n t been sound proofed can only speculate that it may be because it a grade ii listed building not really that big of a deal though if you not an audiophile and also if you going to watch a loud marvel type blockbuster haha,went screening anatomy fall screen grand beautiful chair comfortable space big lobby gorgeous honestly whole building stunning worth least one visit complaint wall thin film screening could hear car honking beeping ambulance siren main road honestly took minute realise noise n t coming movie lol n t could n t stop hearing actually shocking loud sound not sure main screen n t sound proofed speculate may grade ii listed building not really big deal though not audiophile also going watch loud marvel type blockbuster haha
"Ordered a burrito, burger meal, pitta bread and hummus. Half an hour late so rang up and said ‘ if you ordered from Donny eats there no order ’ I wanted to know how he knew I ordered from Donny eats if the order did n’t actually exist hmmm … he could n’t answer. He then said driver was two mins away.
