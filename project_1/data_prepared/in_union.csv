"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.\n\n\n\nMishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.\n\n\n\nMishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.\n\n\n\nThe court proceedings detailed Mishra’s actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.\n\n\n\nOn March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.\n\n\n\nMishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students’ arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.",0,brijesh kumar mishra the main accused in a high profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from canadian colleges has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison mishra who was arrested by the canadian border services agency cbsa on june now faces approximately months of imprisonment after accounting for time served though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term mishra who operated a firm called m s education migration services was charged with multiple offenses under the immigration and refugee protection act these included unauthorized representation counselling misrepresentation and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts the scam which came to light in march affected hundreds of indian students primarily from punjab who were facing deportation from canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake according to the cbsa mishra who hails from darbhanga in bihar was apprehended at an airport in british columbia while attempting to enter canada later years the charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to canadian authorities the court proceedings detailed mishra s actions between january and february during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the immigration and refugee protection act his illegal activities were contrary to section of the act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families on march jalandhar police registered a case against brijesh kumar mishra and his partners under sections and b of the indian penal code ipc the investigation was later transferred to the anti human trafficking unit additionally the jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy mishra charged an average of rs lakh from each student for visa related services and college admissions upon the students arrival in canada mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters he would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake in some instances he returned the college fees but in many cases he did not,brijesh kumar mishra main accuse high profile immigration scam involve fake offer letter canadian college plead guilty three count sentence three year prison mishra arrest canadian border service agency cbsa june face approximately month imprisonment accounting time serve though may eligible parole complete full term mishra operate firm call education migration service charge multiple offense immigration refugee protection act include unauthorized representation counsel misrepresentation aid individual misrepresent withhold material fact scam come light march affect hundred indian student primarily punjab face deportation canada discover offer letter fake accord cbsa mishra hail darbhanga bihar apprehend airport british columbia attempt enter canada later year charge lay stemmed comprehensive criminal investigation reveal offer immigration advice without proper license induce client misrepresent information canadian authority court proceeding detail mishra action january february knowingly advised individual connection immigration application immigration refugee protection act illegal activity contrary section act result significant distress many student family march jalandhar police register case brijesh kumar mishra partner section b indian penal code ipc investigation later transfer anti human traffic unit additionally jalandhar district authority revoke license consultancy mishra charge average rs lakh student visa relate service college admission upon student arrival canada mishra would inform seat unavailable college list offer letter would advise either seek admission college wait next intake instance return college fee many case not

"My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. \nOne time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. \nHe was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. \nSome people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.  \nYou forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed.\nYou were late for reporting to duty?

To that end these fine upstanding most Indian of Indians will sink to any depths, make up any amount of bullshit to spread fear, lie, steal, and cheat their way into positions of power from which they can do their bidding and keep the masses distracted with this petty bullshit so they don't pay attention to the real issues holding the country back.\n\nClannishness begets clannishness.

"I really don't understand the point of all this. Who are they trying to show off to? They are in the top ten richest people list, and everyone knows that. These events look so wannabe. Mukesh is a second generation billionaire, and his children 3rd generation. By this time, most rich people like to stay private and quietly enjoy their life. What weird fetish is this to find reasons to throw another party, invite the stars/high profile people and allow the videos to be posted to the web.\n\nTo us commoners, a Katy Perry concert sounds cool. For the high profile guests attending Ambani events, I doubt anyone cares.

"India's relationship with Russia goes back to the Cold War era. Even though India was part of the non-aligned movement, being a socialist nation with a vast population living in poverty, we were always more attracted towards the USSR as opposed to the USA's mindless capitalism. This friendship stood the test of time through various arms and trade deals, even though Russia and India both look drastically different today than they did in the 1970s. In today's circumstances, India regrettably does not have the privilege to take a moral stand in the Ukraine conflict, even though most of us are opposed to it personally. 1.4 billion Indian people need Russian oil badly, without which the country would come to a standstill. Also, it's important to recognise that this is not Russia's war, it's Putin's war, and our country needs to stand by its ally regardless of their leader. This is not to say that India is happy with these events, we've made some pretty strong statements against the war. I understand that for the Nordic nations, your conflicts with Russia stretch back hundreds of years, but that's not the case with us.",1,india s relationship with russia goes back to the cold war era even though india was part of the non aligned movement being a socialist nation with a vast population living in poverty we were always more attracted towards the ussr as opposed to the usa s mindless capitalism this friendship stood the test of time through various arms and trade deals even though russia and india both look drastically different today than they did in the s in today s circumstances india regrettably does not have the privilege to take a moral stand in the ukraine conflict even though most of us are opposed to it personally billion indian people need russian oil badly without which the country would come to a standstill also it is important to recognise that this is not russia s war it is putin s war and our country needs to stand by its ally regardless of their leader this is not to say that india is happy with these events we have made some pretty strong statements against the war i understand that for the nordic nations your conflicts with russia stretch back hundreds of years but that is not the case with us,india relationship russia go back cold war era even though india part non align movement socialist nation vast population live poverty always attract towards ussr oppose usa mindless capitalism friendship stand test time various arm trade deal even though russia india look drastically different today today circumstance india regrettably not privilege take moral stand ukraine conflict even though u oppose personally billion indian people need russian oil badly without country would come standstill also important recognise not russia war putin war country need stand ally regardless leader not say india happy event make pretty strong statement war understand nordic nation conflict russia stretch back hundred year not case u

"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.\n\nThe problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.\n\nThink about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?\n\nThe answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.\n\nNow, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.\n\nThe answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.\n\nWe have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.\n\nBut this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.\n\nAnd all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.\n\nSo both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.",1,op here is my take on this as any other person on this subreddit you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent the problem about hindu vs muslims is not one about religions it is not about cultural practices either it is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other the problem is however about isolation think about your parents how many muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting say every day or let us say every week every month every year in last years of their lives the answer you will find is very few there is very little exposure today while the world is connected more so than ever the exposure has decreased so where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others from media and i am not talking about news media i am talking about the entire media in general be it songs movies shows art literature etc anyone who is forming their opinions either in positive light or in negative light they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media now why is media so polarising is it because of politics well that has always been true to a partial extent then is it because of apathy that is essentially an outcome is not it so it cannot be that the answer to above will be the need for comfort majority population in every nation in every era in every region has always been on a struggle to survive in times past the working hours were less but the living conditions were not so much in times of current era the living conditions have improved exponentially but so have working hours and need for labour all this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences and this is why they turn to media we have seen examples countless many that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding but this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against and all of this is individual effort it is no one else s responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture no moral responsibility or ethical responsibility lies on others to improve your understanding you yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction so both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and or stand against,op take person subreddit choose ignore go tangent problem hindu v muslims not one religion not cultural practice either nevermore wrong do one community problem however isolation think parent many muslim average interact normal casual setting say every day let u say every week every month every year last year live answer find little exposure today world connect ever exposure decrease get exposure form opinion others medium not talk news medium talk entire medium general song movie show art literature etc anyone form opinion either positive light negative light expose medium medium polarise politics well always true partial extent apathy essentially outcome not not answer need comfort majority population every nation every era every region always struggle survive time past work hour less live condition not much time current era living condition improve exponentially work hour need labour leaf common populace devoid energy look outside find comfortable term opinion think process term experience turn medium see example countless many illustrate people expose widers variety opinion culture able empathise easily others tad bit understanding exposure require ensure get expose wrong right idea culture simply content one side community ideal always make blind side hamper full understand someone may stand opposite end empathy spectrum respect idea culture support stand individual effort no one else responsibility ensure expose every facet idea culture no moral responsibility ethical responsibility lie others improve understand sole heir responsibility others may sometimes come guide helper point direction parent yet fully understand idea culture support stand
"How is it exploitation if it creates work. I don’t understand?\n\nThe delivery drivers are paid for the pickup too right? \nAlso the customers the people you accuse of exploiting aren’t they themselves exploited too then? Someone here rightly pointed out that the consumer is also time bound and taking time off to go return a product, marks a half day for him which directly cut from their pockets.\n\nIf it’s about low standards, harsh timelines, and other factors associated to a job then the whole of Indian is exploited isn’t it?

So many people Ik are on anti depressants because their work gives them bad intrusive thoughts.\n\nAlso if you decide to make your own returns, you in a way would take out from their job as less people would be needed in the market so for the same job? It’s like saying t*s  should either up their mass entry package from 3.5 lpa to 6lpa or shouldn’t hire at all.

"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves. The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.\n\nIsrael has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.\n\nPegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum.

You can also buy korean merch from there in house store. Food is AVERAGE. 1) SOJU is non alcoholic. Also you ca n't take away the bottle( Rs.) if you can not finish it. Tastes like appy fizz mixed with Sprite. 2) the Ramen is n't authentic. They use Maggie which is served with deep fried egg and chicken. It's not a korean noodles. The price point is high. Korean fried wings are good. You can give it a try. 3) beverage like-Vietnamese coffee, dalgona coffee, boba tea, is really good. 4) desserts are also worth trying.

"I recently visited Al Baik fried chicken restaurant and overall, I had a satisfying experience. The fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of KFC, which is quite an accomplishment. The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it. I hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future.",0,i recently visited al baik fried chicken restaurant and overall i had a satisfying experience the fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of kfc which is quite an accomplishment the crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat however i must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired it was adequate but i would rate it out of perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere one aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers which they had posted on social media i was looking forward to trying those deals but unfortunately they were not available during my visit on the positive side the service was prompt and the staff was courteous and attentive they made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant the tables and chairs were well maintained and the washrooms were spotless in conclusion al baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with kfc although the ambience could use some improvement the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it i hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future,recently visit al baik fry chicken restaurant overall satisfying experience fry chicken delicious rival taste kfc quite accomplishment crispy coat tender meat make delightful treat however must admit ambience leave bit desired adequate would rate perhaps could improve decor light enhance din atmosphere one aspect disappoint absence advertise offer post social medium look forward try deal unfortunately not available visit positive side service prompt staff courteous attentive make sure everything need throughout meal another commendable aspect cleanliness restaurant table chair well maintain washroom spotless conclusion al baik offer delectable fried chicken experience easily compete kfc although ambience could use improvement friendly service clean environment compensate hope address issue miss offer provide even well din experience customer future

If you are around Serampore and you want to eat momo then do n't go for wow momo or somewhere else just give it a try. I am sure you will find it very good and better than wow momo. I had 3-4 times experience with different wow momos including Serampore one but I do n't get satisfied with their products. Now why am I praising them 1. The price point is very lucrative 5 pc is their mini and 8 pc is their large. Veg momo starts with 50 and 70 for mini and large. 2. The stuffing of chicken is absolutely full i mean there is nothing than the chicken And do n't get fooled by the size the momo is absolutely compact filled momo. Just one thing i do nt like them there is no proper seating arrangement and so crowded even sometimes insects also drops to your food first day we experienced that so today we took away. We ate steam veg momo chicken momo and chicken gravy momo and butter mayo chicken momo. You should try veg steam momo and chicken gravy momo. So it is recommended folks.

"The hotel is very near to shanivar wada entrance. We had Punjabi thali, it had many items and was more than sufficient for one person. It had naan raita pulao chole paneer dahi and a small lassi shot. Price is also in budget 250 RS per thali and it's value for money. The ambience is good just one problem I felt the behaviour of the waiter was a bit rude and in attitude not sure why, maybe because we were not Marathi.

Starting from the start. It was well packed. Delivery was fast. I ordered Kolkata Chicken Biryani. I must say they did a good job on making it quite similar to Kolkata biryani. But they can make it better of course. The quantity was really good. But the quality of chicken was less. And the chicken was also little dry. They can improve in this. And of course the price is very high. In Kolkata we get double portion in half the price. So yeah that's from my side. Overall the experience and ambience created by the pot and the candles was really nice.

"A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises. I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.",1,a flavorful culinary experience with a few salty surprises i recently dined at spice garden restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing the ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon making it a pleasant dining experience for starters the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit the perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out the steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well prepared showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites moving on to the main course the spice garden non veg platter was a generous assortment of flavors however i must mention that the chicken changezi and malai soya chaap were a bit on the salty side which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes it would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience the bread basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal offering a variety of textures and tastes despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes the overall food quality was commendable the service was too slow and un attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course the restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family in conclusion spice garden restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere i recommend trying their starters especially the chilli momos and prawns while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience,flavorful culinary experience salty surprise recently din spice garden restaurant indulge delightful spread dish leave taste bud buzz ambience outdoor deck seat provide charm backdrop afternoon make pleasant din experience starter chilli momos chilli prawn absolute hit perfect blend spice right amount heat make dish stand steam momos seekh kebab kathi roll also well prepared showcasing chef expertise craft appetizing bite move main course spice garden non veg platter generous assortment flavor however must mention chicken changezi malai soya chaap bit salty side somewhat affect overall enjoyment dish would great kitchen could adjust salt level enhance din experience bread basket hot gulab jamun vanilla ice cream delightful addition meal offer variety texture taste despite minor setback saltiness dish overall food quality commendable service slow un attentive cause negative aspect din experience may new untrained person take order starter vanish run back reception fetch bottle water order something next course restaurant ambiance outdoor seat make ideal spot relax even friend family conclusion spice garden restaurant delivers satisfy culinary journey diverse menu charm atmosphere recommend try starter especially chilli momos prawn hop slight adjustment salt level train hospitable staff perfect dining experience

"One of the best place to have kongu food. 4 star only due to non-veg meals & service can be improved a bit. We had dishes based on my friend recommendations who hail from Salem. Kadhambam side dish-amazing. Prepared as a mixture frim most parts of goat-liver, kidney, manga. The curry was also too good. It was very fresh. MUST TRY DISH. Pichi potta kooli fry-if your a lover of spicy food go for it. It was prepared with good amount of pepper. Eat this dish you we get your mouth hot. It tasted to next level with rasam & curd rice. Mutton Biriyani-Heavenly food. No other words. Non-veg meals-it was not to our expectations when compared to Chennai meals. It had two varieties of non-veg curry but for us it was like veg curry no flavour of non-veg. It comes with a boiled egg & unlimited meals. But they claim this is there speciality meal. If you plan for meal, my suggestion is go for veg meals & order non veg side dish. One more think, the salt was less in most of the dishes so add it for your taste to enjoy it. The hotel is just on the bye-pass before you reach Salem & before the Salem famous Selvi mess. It has ample parking area with a friendly elderly person to assist you in parking.

"The restaurant location next to Padav Brij is decent, but our dining experience left much to be desired. While the restaurant boasts a flashy ambiance, what matters most to customers is food quality, quantity, and taste, all of which were compromised here. We initially tried to order Hyderabadi Biryani, only to be told it was n't available, which was puzzling for a dinner item during dinner hours. We settled for the Chilli Paneer-Fried Rice combo and cold coffee, which set us back 357 rupees, an amount that seemed excessive given the meager portions we received. Unfortunately, when our order arrived, it felt like they had reheated a frozen dish in the oven for five minutes, as the fried rice lacked freshness. Taste-wise, you can find similar options at more affordable prices elsewhere in Gwalior.",0,the restaurant location next to padav brij is decent but our dining experience left much to be desired while the restaurant boasts a flashy ambiance what matters most to customers is food quality quantity and taste all of which were compromised here we initially tried to order hyderabadi biryani only to be told it was n t available which was puzzling for a dinner item during dinner hours we settled for the chilli paneer fried rice combo and cold coffee which set us back rupees an amount that seemed excessive given the meager portions we received unfortunately when our order arrived it felt like they had reheated a frozen dish in the oven for five minutes as the fried rice lacked freshness taste wise you can find similar options at more affordable prices elsewhere in gwalior,restaurant location next padav brij decent din experience leave much desire restaurant boast flashy ambiance matter customer food quality quantity taste compromise initially tried order hyderabadi biryani tell n t available puzzling dinner item dinner hour settle chilli paneer fry rice combo cold coffee set u back rupee amount seem excessive give meager portion receive unfortunately order arrive felt like reheat frozen dish oven five minute fry rice lack freshness taste wise find similar option affordable price elsewhere gwalior

"This was once a best theatre around this region, But right now it is not upto the mark. It badly needs renovation. I have been visiting this theatre since childhood and it was good until 5 years back. After then there were lots of things that felt like should be improved. The sound quality is really poor and inside the theatre and there are literally spiderwebs on the walls. There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian. This theatre really has scope to get improved, but has not made any improvements recently. The snacks inside this theatre is not that much great. You get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips, popcorn and egg puffs. When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience). The Air conditioning system is really good in this theatre. If someone from the theatre management sees this review, kindly take them into consideration and please make improvements.

I visited this place for dessert, and I was amazed by their Choco lava cake, it was definitely better than Domino or Pizza Hut. It was just rich in melted chocolate and it was baked so well. I will definitely try their pizza next time. The price can be a bit much depending on the size of pizza. The place is good, with good parking space but there is not a lot of seating space.

"This is just a roadside' Haatgadi' selling Poha in the morning. But it is very popular locally as is seen from the crowd here every morning. What is different in the Poha here is it contains pieces of fried batata( potatoes). There are 2 options-normal for RS 10 and special for RS 15.

"I've been a regular customer of Second Wife for quite some time, and the food quality has typically been fantastic. Although my recent experience might not have been perfect, I'd still rate it a solid 4 for several reasons. First, let me address today experience. We ordered Dragon Chicken, and it was a bit tougher than usual, not meeting our expectations. The Chilli Garlic Fried Rice was decent, but the Oriental Chicken dish was unexpectedly spicy, making it a bit challenging to enjoy. However, the reason for my 4-star rating lies in the consistent quality of food I've enjoyed in the past at Second Wife. The Kebabs, in particular, have always been a highlight, with their delicious flavors and perfect texture. This restaurant has been a reliable choice for tasty food, and I hope that today experience was just a one-time hiccup.

"Its a good food joint for grabbing some quick bite like evening snacks especially pizza, sandwich, burgers, shakes, etc. I tried their Mexican chicken pizza medium size and it was really good in terms of quality and quantity. Next I tried their special non veg sandwich which I felt satisfactory. Their beverage section was not that updated, they had only milk shake and items like lime soda, mohito etc. which were present in the menu but they were unable to provide. Another drawback I think is their washing area; a small basin is there with a separate jug kept which one needs to pour and wash the hands if required; but that may be due to the lack of space.

Food was amazing. We tried many things. I loved Italian and Mexican burgers. Pizza was ok. Their monster garlic bread is a must.( Not sure if the name is correct but this is the biggest they have). Do not go for their pull apart garlic bread. It costs 150. The bigger one is around 190 or 200 but is double in size. We also tried hazelnut coffee. It was good but the quantity was not 330 ml as mentioned in the menu. So it could n't justify the 140 INR price tag. But the taste was good. Food preparation time was a bit longer.

With lots of exceptions as brown bear is a good brand and has opened their store in alwal which happens closer to my place I happened to visit this store today 6 Feb 2024 evening on entering the store the first appearance table was dirty not cleaned dirty odour and the guy at counter least bothered as customer entered he was in his own world speaking loud on phone his assistant who looked like cleaning boy has come and served us a pastry which we asked for and the pastry tasted stale on asking the person at counter he is least bothered to what I was saying then I had to raise my voice then he disconnected the call and he was talking very harsh with me then he gave me a small piece from other pastry to taste that was ok then I asked him why stale one was served he simply say's next time we'll serve you the good one... Then I asked how about the pastry which he gave me taste he says we'll patch it and give to other customer... That sounded sooo disgusting.....

And of course, the Chinese food out there is quite good as there are even multiple shops and one can have it all at a cheaper price. I tried a few shops and vendors at Janakpuri west as well for Chinese food like a spring roll, momos, fries, etc. Momos are readily available and of great taste and quality but only a few here have spring roll in their menu. And I had them from two different shops-Tilak Momos & Chinese Thapa. But none of them were good. They were n't at all crispy, stuffing was also not so good. Spicy Ninja had much better spring rolls than the rest, they were crispy like I wanted. Masala Peri-peri fries were also good enough.

"Nothing to say about brand mio amore. Because we all know the quality of food products. All are quality products. I can review the branches of the shop. As at Burdwan town itself has 3 or 4 branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream. Actually I do n't like all the items here in which Maine part is mostly different types of cream. The snacks items available here are so so. Can not say the best.

"Prachi is a familiar name when it comes to heritage standalone movie theatres of Kolkata. Prachi began it's operations in the year 1948, the year after India gained Independence. Founder Jiten Basu launched his venture and his son Dipendranath took over soon after. However, his stewardship was short-lived, and Dipendranath passed away while his father was still alive. It was then left to Jiten Basu granddaughter Bidisha to take charge, and her battle for survival continued amidst the strong challenges posed by the multiplexes and mushrooming OTT platforms. While Prachi initially screened only Bengali films, it has evolved with the times to now accommodate Hindi and English cinema too. Basu has even upgraded the projection system to screen 3D films.",1,prachi is a familiar name when it comes to heritage standalone movie theatres of kolkata prachi began it is operations in the year the year after india gained independence founder jiten basu launched his venture and his son dipendranath took over soon after however his stewardship was short lived and dipendranath passed away while his father was still alive it was then left to jiten basu granddaughter bidisha to take charge and her battle for survival continued amidst the strong challenges posed by the multiplexes and mushrooming ott platforms while prachi initially screened only bengali films it has evolved with the times to now accommodate hindi and english cinema too basu has even upgraded the projection system to screen d films,prachi familiar name come heritage standalone movie theatre kolkata prachi begin operation year year india gain independence founder jiten basu launch venture son dipendranath take soon however stewardship short live dipendranath pass away father still alive leave jiten basu granddaughter bidisha take charge battle survival continue amidst strong challenge pose multiplex mushroom ott platform prachi initially screen bengali film evolve time accommodate hindi english cinema basu even upgrade projection system screen film

"One of the best Biryani joints in town. Both mutton and chicken biryanis are great. Half plate has good portions. Liked the mutton chap too. Only issue is they run out of the mutton biryani quite fast like by 7 pm. Otherwise would have been a 5 star. Over the years price has increased quite a bit. Maybe they should remove the cheap from the name. They have an AC dining area in the 1st floor but the AC stays off in the "" winter ""( like every other shop with AC in town) and the windows also stay closed. This makes the dining area very hot, stuffy and stinky. So maybe it's better to dine at the non AC ground floor if you are okay with a bit of dust.

"Went at on Sunday and was not expecting it to be crowded in fact we got the last table available that was for 6, we were only 4( including a 5 year old). Did not expect it to be so crowded at 8 actually so after 8 you can expect waiting. Ambience is good no doubt. 1) The Turkish lamb soup was nice. 2) The hummus with chicken was also nice, tandoori roti was a little dry though but I ca n't complain. 3) Chicken Cheese Fatayer is good. 4) Chicken Ankara Tandoori was nice but had better tandoori than this. 5) Chicken Mandi rice was okay. Plus 1 Bisleri and Sprite for the above entire menu we paid which I think was little on the higher side. Did not expect this much, anyways actually the amount is high because the quantity is limited. The staff was very courteous and polite they were not properly trained but there attitude towards there guest was commendable. One table besides us ordered fish and than the couple complained that it was bland and no taste, the staff said in Turkish cuisine this is the taste but the couple did not agree. Although I feel the hotel was right they gave them a completely new chicken dish and took the fish back. So there attitude is right, the management must he having this attitude hence the employees carry it, trickle down effect. Overall Food is good Quantity is less Ambience is nice Price is high But The attitude is just right.

Chicken lollipops are worst. I got leftover food delivered to me which I ordered through swiggy, chicken was hard to chew and dry. Also, have tasted nalli gosh biryani which is awesome in taste. I can see that the quality is decreasing over the time. We have ordered: mutton hot & sour soup( Rs 145), tandoori half plate( Rs 250), mutton dum biryani( Rs 350). 1. Mutton soup was a bit spicy. Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3.

"Dominos are everywhere! I love the taste of their chicken wings. They are pretty delicious. Do not forget to try those if you happen to visit this place. Despite its noisy location, the food here is delicious. However, my experience here is not up to the mark. Firstly, it's crazy to witness the other female staff arguing with the male staff( who seems to be the head of the same group of workers). Keeping their argument aside, I am overwhelmed to see how the male staff handled the situation, with complete patience( although he struck the table out loud once). It's normal to argue with a coworker, right ?! We all do once in a while but choose the location wisely. To be honest, I'm completely unsure of what was going on since I do not speak Assamese.

Somedays before in Instagram I saw the new branch of this Shop in kannur, but I was not sure that all items will be available or not. So I took phone number from Google and made call but it connected to Thalassery branch. Even I made call to enquire about kannur branch they were very customer friendly and clarify my all enquiries. So we decided to go. We reached there by 0900pm in the night, shop opens till 10 in the night. In ground floor only cakes are available, there are a variety of cakes in different flavours. Dine-in were arranged in the first floor. Staircase is very steep, i do n't prefer old people to visit here coz no seating is arranged in the ground floor. Interior were very welcoming. Table was nicely arrange to sit 4 or 5 person. We ordered Eiffel tower and Jabulani delight. Both costs _ each. Eiffel tower is the combination of cakes and Icecreams. First 3 layer is icecreams and other are cakes. At top of the tower there is a ferroro Rocher placed. Presentation of both were amazing and mesmerizing one. Jabulani delight is also a mixture of cakes and Icecreams. It's loaded with nuts and dryfruits.

"1. Fish fry: Size is jumbo. The layer should be thin, marination of fish may be better, and the thickness of fish should be thicker according to the price. Taste is good but not wow! The fish looks a little bit dry to me. 2. Mutton Biryani: Quantity, quality, and taste of Mutton with flavorful Biryani Rice are awesome. It is enough for two persons for dinner. A boiled egg may be added as an egg is one of the essential parts of "" Kolkata Style Biryani ""! Mutton may be boiled more according to me. Aloo Bukhara and Barista can be added. A small amount of Raita or Burhani or Green Chutney( of Pudina, Coriander leaves, green chili, etc.) or at least Green Salad should be given.

Best cafe in kottayam situated opposite to Ceaser Palace. Got ample car parking. Opens upto 12 am. Staffs are super friendly. I am a reqular customer since their initial time. Found best in town at that time. But today sad to say that the items are not consistent in taste wise. Best dishes # Steak with mashed potato and sauted veggies # tikka with afgani rice # crispy fried burger # crumb fried sausages # penne pasta with meat balls # loaded Fries # Club sandwich # Fried samoosa # hot chocolate( advised not to add extra sugar as it is already sweeetened) # Lemon ice tea # juices # waffles # Ceaser salad # Brownie # coffee # shakes # blood Mary mojitos Juicy Lucy burger is not that ones which we get in abroad. Not recommended. Outdoor seating is there. Advised to sit outside if you are planning for a date or a meeting beacuse the music that they are playing is at high volume and can cause irritation. They got a massive 75 inch television for live matches. Got barista machine. Clean and neat washroom is there. Even if you tell them for rare or medium rare beef steak you will get only welldone UPI and POS is there. Never expect taste consistency.

"The valley of Kashmir has unique geographical features. Being home to the rarest of natural beauties, Kashmir hosts some of the most wondrous places in the world. When we think of Kashmir, the first thing we visualise is the beautiful Shikaras in Dal Lake, the exquisite Mughal Gardens, the cascading Shrunz and Aharbal waterfalls, the magical Betaab valley, the stunning Sonamarg and the glorious Gulmarg. True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir. Chattabal of Chitergul-Shangus area is just 32 km from district Anantnag and merely 20 km away from the famous Mughal Garden of Achabal, situated in the lap of Pir Panjal mountains. Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature. The vast green plains look like natural tapestries, as if spread by divine hands. It has two routes through which people can reach the place: one is from Shangus road, and the second is from KP Kehribal.",1,the valley of kashmir has unique geographical features being home to the rarest of natural beauties kashmir hosts some of the most wondrous places in the world when we think of kashmir the first thing we visualise is the beautiful shikaras in dal lake the exquisite mughal gardens the cascading shrunz and aharbal waterfalls the magical betaab valley the stunning sonamarg and the glorious gulmarg true kashmir being one absolute jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet one among them is chattabal surrounded with serene himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir chattabal of chitergul shangus area is just km from district anantnag and merely km away from the famous mughal garden of achabal situated in the lap of pir panjal mountains chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about not many people go in that direction primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in anantnag the majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from anantnag or any of the nearby villages the valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature the vast green plains look like natural tapestries as if spread by divine hands it has two routes through which people can reach the place one is from shangus road and the second is from kp kehribal,valley kashmir unique geographical feature home rare natural beauty kashmir host wondrous place world think kashmir first thing visualise beautiful shikaras dal lake exquisite mughal garden cascade shrunz aharbal waterfalls magical betaab valley stun sonamarg glorious gulmarg true kashmir one absolute jannat heaven earth brim natural splendour every corner still place valley unheard unexplored yet one among chattabal surround serene himalayan range meadow pine fir chattabal chitergul shangus area km district anantnag merely km away famous mughal garden achabal situate lap pir panjal mountain chattabal not really name many tourist know not many people go direction primarily not high list place visit anantnag majority folk find local anantnag nearby village valley replete natural vegetation flower wild nature vast green plain look like natural tapestry spread divine hand two route people reach place one shangus road second kp kehribal

"The restaurant is just near the road and have a variety of food for their menu, they also accept google pay and other services as well.

They only have two paper towel for each table, they have two huge mirrors, a bunch of small mirrors and a fish tank, some paintings on the wall as well, the windows are damaged and cracked, also have n't been cleaned in awhile. There's few books for decoration, the walls are dirty and some have cracks The special coffee is a bit large and served in a thick metallic cup and tastes good. The beef roll is a bit small, the beef is chewy and the roll or paratha is tough. It tastes less than expected for 60 rupees. A bit oily, too much oil for my taste. It also lacks taste and you can taste the burnt paratha as well. Plain rice taste like plain rice, not too bad and not great. Chilli smells bad and just plain hot without any flavour Customer service is bad without much thought for the customer at all. They're extremely loud and the waiting time was long.

The French fries was in a small portion. On a big plate so it appeared to be less than it should have. I'm not sure if water is charged automatically but they gave us a water bottle and charged us for it without our request. It was n't much but I just found it amusing that we were billed for something we did n't request. Overall it was great food.

"Today, I had an incredibly disappointing experience at Cake Hut. Despite being in the store to purchase a birthday cake, the staff seemed entirely disinterested in assisting myself or any other customers. Despite their presence, they were absorbed in their own tasks, neglecting to engage with us. When I asked about the available cakes, the response was unhelpful and vague, with the staff member simply stating they were all chocolate cakes without providing any further details. It was evident that the staff lacked basic customer service skills and failed to understand the importance of attentive service. As a result, I decided to take my business elsewhere. I sincerely hope Cake Hut takes this feedback seriously and implements necessary improvements in staff training. My experience today deserves 0 stars, reflecting the complete lack of professionalism and attentiveness from the staff.",0,today i had an incredibly disappointing experience at cake hut despite being in the store to purchase a birthday cake the staff seemed entirely disinterested in assisting myself or any other customers despite their presence they were absorbed in their own tasks neglecting to engage with us when i asked about the available cakes the response was unhelpful and vague with the staff member simply stating they were all chocolate cakes without providing any further details it was evident that the staff lacked basic customer service skills and failed to understand the importance of attentive service as a result i decided to take my business elsewhere i sincerely hope cake hut takes this feedback seriously and implements necessary improvements in staff training my experience today deserves stars reflecting the complete lack of professionalism and attentiveness from the staff,today incredibly disappointing experience cake hut despite store purchase birthday cake staff seem entirely disinterested assist customer despite presence absorb task neglect engage u ask available cake response unhelpful vague staff member simply state chocolate cake without provide detail evident staff lack basic customer service skill fail understand importance attentive service result decide take business elsewhere sincerely hope cake hut take feedback seriously implement necessary improvement staff train experience today deserve star reflect complete lack professionalism attentiveness staff

Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history.

"Sri Venkateshwara Bhavan( Avanthi) Tucked inside Avanthi Lodge lively atmosphere, Sri Venkateshwara Bhavan is a beloved spot for delicious Udupi cuisine. Fondly called "" Avanthi, "" this vegetarian gem attracts crowds all day, drawn by its famous South Indian breakfasts and satisfying lunch meals. The recent renovation has breathed new life into the establishment. The makeover has not only enhanced its visual appeal but also improved the dining experience with a brighter, more inviting ambiance, thanks to the strategic placement of glass windows that usher in an abundance of natural light. The menu proudly showcases classic Udupi vegetarian fare, each dish a delightful representation of South India rich culinary traditions.

"My friend and I visited Dada Boudi Barrackpore Restaurant today, and we had a fantastic dining experience. We started with their fish fry, which was absolutely delicious. The staff recommended their special tandoori fish fry, which we found delightful. Following that, we tried their chicken malai kebab, which was also excellent. However, when we ordered the chicken biryani, we found the chicken a bit chewy, and the potatoes were undercooked. Nonetheless, we ended our meal on a high note with their refreshing lime soda, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it was a great dining experience with tasty food, and we would definitely visit again.",0,my friend and i visited dada boudi barrackpore restaurant today and we had a fantastic dining experience we started with their fish fry which was absolutely delicious the staff recommended their special tandoori fish fry which we found delightful following that we tried their chicken malai kebab which was also excellent however when we ordered the chicken biryani we found the chicken a bit chewy and the potatoes were undercooked nonetheless we ended our meal on a high note with their refreshing lime soda which we thoroughly enjoyed overall it was a great dining experience with tasty food and we would definitely visit again,friend visit dada boudi barrackpore restaurant today fantastic dining experience start fish fry absolutely delicious staff recommend special tandoori fish fry find delightful follow tried chicken malai kebab also excellent however order chicken biryani find chicken bit chewy potato undercooked nonetheless end meal high note refresh lime soda thoroughly enjoy overall great din experience tasty food would definitely visit

"Are you stuck up in a traffic ? ? I guess getting into the cafe is more better than waiting for long time in the traffic. I really liked the name of the cafe "" Traffic Jam "". I know at Teen Hath Naka( a place or i must say a traffic joint where one has to wait for long time due to traffic. It's in Thane.) we face this issue but coming up with the name of the cafe itself is something different. I liked their interiors it gives a perfect feel where how one waits in long traffics with traffic signal sign and stuff. Also their table is made like a road kinda thing something so unique. They've got some props and also a zebra coloured scooter for photobooth. For all you photogenic people do n't miss to get your selfies and come up with different poses. Coming to what I had here. 1. Flavoured Margarita: I liked this moctail which I felt it had the taste of the strawberry. It was really refreshing. 2. Go slow Indiana Pizza: This pizza had sauted bell peppers, onions, sundried tomatoes and cottage cheese. It really tasted well. The pizza base too was good. Must have.

"The place looks excellent from outside, the decor is quite cool and everything but staying there reveals the real place! Firstly, some ground floor rooms are abominable. Also some upper floor rooms have old window AC and old TV! Now coming to the service, the buffet breakfast is really small with about 4 items and although they claim that it starts at 7, you can not get anything before and at times even before 8! The bar is kinda not up to the standards of a family restaurant. It gives off a seedy vibe which makes it not a good place to be with one family. While the Indian food served in this place is quite delectable the Chinese food is a real horror! There's no swimming pool. Also if you want to hang out your wet clothes from a trip to the beach they do not offer a place for that. You have to go for their highly expensive laundry service instead.

"The restaurant is only just beautiful to look at. The dishes they are serving on an average. The atmosphere and ambiance are just beautiful. They are arranged dining very properly and neatly maintained. But we expect much for serving food taste. They served their Special Mutton biryani, Talassery chicken biryani butter naan and Schezwan noodles. They told Thalassery biriyani, especially mutton biryani is their special but the biriyani is not like Thalassery style only giving normal biryani named Thalassery and the price put to plus GST( high price). It's actually 3 star restaurant pricing, but the restaurant is just an Multicusine not having a three star rating still. Mutton was overcooked and already lost its texture. Biriyani masal is also In a confused state. Schezwan Noodles was the worst one. Totally disappointed.

"Hordes of people, a wall like rack lined with packets of bread, that's the way to spot Madhuram Sandwich. Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat.
