You re quite wrong on all fronts  which is consistent for your take on this matter but I ll explain  Again   Genocide is a  jus cogens  offence  As such  the Australian state cannot punish it  it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that s it  South Africa  in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home  when electoral woes were headed their way  sought to make a case for it in the ICJ  and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since      Our   obligation under the convention is for the prevention  though    Not   the punishment  Some objective research would have illustrated why  and I ll have to explain it for you because of the pesky  objective  part   The first jus cogens trial  for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved  but he was in UNGAR      fun fact   was the Nuremberg trials  Here  the new German government did not punish the old  nor did the US take the lead  A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges    When the Rwandan genocide went to trial  it was at a UN backed  International Tribunal   Similarly  when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars  it was via a UN international tribunal   ICTY     This is not coincidence  It is a function of a jus cogens offence  because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts  no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it  In other words  you can  only  have an international legal trial    The right thing has happened  the ICJ was involved  Australia s best bet is to let that play out  and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don t say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic  lest someone take them seriously,0,quit wrong front consist take matter explain genocid ju cogen offenc australian state not punish solemn duti prevent south africa bold move distract anc critic home elector woe head way sought make case icj rule ignorantli wil interpret sinc oblig convent prevent though not punish object research would illustr explain peski object part first ju cogen trial doc evatt not involv ungar fun fact nuremberg trial new german govern not punish old nor us take lead tribun conven panel alli judg rwandan genocid went trial un back intern tribun similarli serbian leadership went trial genocid commit yugoslav war via un intern tribun icti not coincid function ju cogen offenc oppos applic ju commun domest court no state permit derog norm nor validli punish word intern legal trial right thing happen icj involv australia best bet let play make sure polit legal ignor senat t say kind stupid shit normal reserv horrif unqualifi redditor topic lest someon take serious

This is an old post I ve shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit   Australian ecologist here  my god  there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread   Okay  first up  there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere  This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism  The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world s most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD   study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison  To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity  check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry s LD   page   For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with  one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia  First there was the best snakes of all  fact   the Aspidites   primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved  Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around  so when the elapids came down from Asia  there was lots of space for them to diversify into  Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs  cobras  mamba  etc  All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids   Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock  Since elapids were the main game in town for so long  they diversified to take over all niches  from super venomous  which get a lot of attention  to nearly lacking venom all together  which no one pays much attention to    So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes  not just highly venomous ones  Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they re here is missing the bigger picture   The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans   Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world  We haven t had a spider bite fatality since the    s  and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed   South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia  including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals       Edit  I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes non lethal snakes for a few different countries here  Australia ain t so bad,0,old post shamelessli copi past explain belief bullshit australian ecologist god lot rubbish tout thread okay first not danger anim australia elsewher misconcept fuel silli exotic famou list australia nearli world venom snake come terribl ld studi use five oversea snake comparison get accur impress rel venom toxic check dr bryan greig fri ld page question mani venom snake begin one look dispers snake within australia first best snake fact aspidit primit snake branch snake famili python evolv australia pretti empti guy around elapid came asia lot space diversifi elapid venom snake fix front fang cobra mamba etc venom snake australia descend elapid australia pretti venom snake came highli venom stock sinc elapid main game town long diversifi take nich super venom get lot attent nearli lack venom togeth no one pay much attent australia divers rang venom snake not highli venom one focus big hitter make ridicul guess miss bigger pictur venom sea snake simpli land elapid diversifi ocean spider not venom anywher els world t spider bite fatal sinc even children elderli succumb south america africa mani venom speci australia includ venom lizard venom mammal edit work ratio lethal snake non lethal snake differ countri australia t bad

Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics   In my opinion  if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public  you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process  that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation  We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building   If it was not an emergency   years ago or even   year ago  it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling  It s simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime  events will still happen like the stabbing of   people at Bondi  it s a tragedy  but it doesn t represent an emergency   I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative   I also don t understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee jerk and compromised solution  Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk  especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point   Isn t the High Court also bound to minimise harm  or die on the hill of point of law,0,bail tri predetermin guilt use profil characterist opinion want minimis depriv freedom maximis secur public find measur accomplish without predetermin outcom judici process mean detent secur hotel convent freedom provid except leav premis protect detail accus home prevent take advantag situat could even combin court accommod separ part build not emerg year ago even year ago not nation emerg crime steadili fall simpli not possibl get zero crime whilst tri minimis crime event still happen like stab peopl bondi tragedi t repres emerg believ stem idiot legisl indefinit detent equal idiot lack legal altern also t understand high court suddenli strike legisl year inact result compromis secur public govern rush implement emerg legisl knee jerk compromis solut sure high court could advis govern like challeng suffici advanc permit well thought legisl put place strike legisl put public risk especi sinc indefinit detent noth done point t high court also bound minimis harm die hill point law

Mining        The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning  The one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for    percent of your operating costs  but it s available for existing facilities as well as new ones  And it doesn t have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production         Super Tax Breaks        They probably don t involve the same degree of economic costs  They have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality  and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain  which is fraying  And so  the big one  the biggest hole is super tax breaks  So  they re costing    billion a year    It s about   percent of GDP  They ll pretty soon cost more than the age pension  They re obviously not very well targeted  Half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households  I put these in two buckets  There s the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it s not going to hurt you too much    And that is title limits on pretax contributions  It s raising the tax rate on some of those pre tax contributions through division     tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool  And if you do those  there s   or   billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end    And then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age     you re not going to pay any tax on your earnings  You basically had to check out of the tax system and that s costing Australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year  And that s not really sustainable in the long term         NDIS       Yeah  look  and look  this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that s growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that s growing slower than the economy  you know  you know  you ve got something you ve got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we re willing to pay    At the outset of the NDIS  there was a really important you know  piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to  into employment and that s part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself  Was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve   they lean towards it being largely erroneous             Housing       I think that s a great question  And the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we haven t built enough  That s why housing in part is so expensive  It s not the only factor  but it s certainly a factor that we have some control over  And if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy         Healthcare       As the Commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well  you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports  you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government  And so  you see you know  we  we ve seen historically  the Commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care        And leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals  Or in the case of the NDIS  you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state based settings  And as the states have less money to spend  they re going to be less cooperative in  in  in those conversations    And I think this comes back to the fact that Australian Federation wasn t well designed on the tax side  We ve got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states  downstream services sitting with states  but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the Commonwealth     Job Seeker    Look  it s a really tough one  because I think it s clear that we need the rise  So  JobSeeker for a long time has been well below the level that I think allows people to be empowered to go and find work as well as survive    If they re on that payment for a while  we ve seen increases for originally from the Coalition and then in Labor last year  That mean that the payments gone up by    a week in real terms  Our position had always been it needed to rise by at least     a week  So  we re still    dollars a week away from that  I could have imagined a world where we did more of

One of Australia s most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value add  This country has the world s third largest population of sheep   behind China and India   but much of the Australian wool clothing we wear is imported  such as men s suits from Italy  There are a multitude of similar examples  Why is it so difficult to add value here  to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials  The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high  we don t have the necessary skills  our design and managerial systems  capacities are limited or deficient  among a host of others  While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments  it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development   The Coalition s usual response has been that such development should be left to the market  however  the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage  The Albanese government s Future Made in Australia  FMIA  strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility  One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy  recognising that this country s transition to a cheaper  clean energy future  and possibly into a global energy superpower  is the most significant industrial shift to come   A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week  Of course  the visionless  destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power  They claim renewables don t work when the sun doesn t shine and the wind doesn t blow   ignoring the potential for cost effective energy storage from these sources  As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out  this country learnt how to store water when it doesn t rain all the time  so why not sun and wind power   The battery strategy sets out a  vision  over the next decade  in which Australia becomes  a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials  providing secure and resilient battery supply chains  delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians  boosting productivity  and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition    We certainly have the minerals in abundance  in a strong resources sector  as well as manufacturers  know how  sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce  The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments  We just need to get on with it   The global battery industry is dominated by China  whose market share is estimated to be as high as    per cent  although there are other significant players such as Japan s Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures  I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk  who said he didn t want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries  Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla  The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous  A particular focus domestically is achieving grid scale and community storage  beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals  I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite  as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite  which would seem to be an advantage  as natural graphite has superior heat storing capacity  Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic  and mostly manufactured by the Chinese  using a dirty and energy intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke  a residue of the oil refining industry  to synthetic graphite  I am also aware of an Australian patented technology that uses a self contained chemical process  with no wastage  to refine natural graphite  removing  impurities  such as iron and silica  and further improving the storage capabilities  Miners can also market these byproducts  providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite   Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential  which should be released by the government s battery strategy  An important related point is the potential of graphite based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia  as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and  in part  because of the fad like attraction of pumped hydro  This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated   note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy      the mother of all pumped hydro projects  which  as I pointed out in an earlier column  didn t stack up on a rigorous cost benefit analysis   The potential advantages of graphite based thermal storage for grid scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised  Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery  fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels  This would enable each house to draw electricity  and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling  even for cooking  as required  These homes might never again receive a power bill   Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures  which would be significant for industries such as processed food  cement  and even steel making   There is an important distinction in grid scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load shifting batteries  The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short term back up to variations in power supply  whereas a load shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks  for example  guaranteeing dispatchable or base load electricity   The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government s battery strategy  Specifically         million for a  battery breakthrough  initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on  high value battery products  that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition  There was a further       million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise       million to deliver an  Australian made battery precinct  in partnership with the Queensland government and      billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation  commercialisation  pilot and demonstration projects and early stage developments in priority sectors  including development in battery technologies   The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination  both domestically and internationally  In Australia  state and local governments must collaborate  along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation  CEFC   the Australian Renewable Energy Agency  ARENA  and private financiers  These efforts may also need community action plans  including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments  Internationally  it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China  Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US s anti China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China  where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money   Of course  an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals  The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources  the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians  As easy as this is to say  the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the Rudd Gillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry   Whatever happens  this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward  In summary  the government s battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition,1,one australia frustrat failur nation limit capac valu add countri world third largest popul sheep behind china india

As a niche interest protest party  the Greens care little about the impact their hardline positions would have on ordinary Australians  The undergraduate and destructive stance taken by G reens leader Adam Bandt   on the October   terrorist attacks by  Hamas against Israel   is proof enough of the harm the far left party poses to  Australia s community cohesion    The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but  as outrageous as the anti Israel stand is  it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government  When allowed to get close to the levers of power   as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government  and with a balance of power position in the federal Senate today   the  Greens are exposed   for the wreckers they are   The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens  Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight  Good policy   most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups   has been put on ice to appease the Greens  Changes to the nation s environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world  something business supports   Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its      bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens  Whatever one may think about the Albanese government s corporate subsidy agenda  the Greens will only make it worse   The Greens have pledged to use their balance of power position to frustrate the government s wider agenda  This includes housing  where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner city seats  Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties  For all the high ideals expressed before the last election  the teals have failed to make an impression  The Greens  once again  have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions,0,nich interest protest parti green care littl impact hardlin posit would ordinari australian undergradu destruct stanc taken g reen leader adam bandt octob terrorist attack hama israel proof enough harm far left parti pose australia commun cohes inflammatori detour foreign polici calcul embarrass anthoni albanes outrag anti israel stand part bigger threat green repres nation ident good govern allow get close lever power de facto coalit gillard labor govern balanc power posit feder senat today green expos wrecker albanes govern yet prove substanc stand green record date one eager cut deal shi away fight good polici recent legisl give certainti offshor ga industri discourag unjustifi lawfar attack protest group put ice appeas green chang nation environment law delay difficult find sensibl way allow develop protect natur world someth busi support labor alreadi said delay introduc legisl bn packag product credit hydrogen produc critic miner process announc feder budget allow time negoti green whatev one may think albanes govern corpor subsidi agenda green make wors green pledg use balanc power posit frustrat govern wider agenda includ hous focus renter green outflank feder govern elector inner citi seat voter must heed lesson minor parti high ideal express last elect teal fail make impress green shown action make polit economi poorer intervent

The article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people   Direct democracy can t fail to achieve the good of the majority  although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason  I was going to include compassion  however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end  it s part of the wisdom in  do unto others as you would have others do unto you    However  direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out  Nothing is perfect  but better is more useful than worse or the same   Therefore  I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy  to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment  along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it  basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum  and reduced working hours to allow them to participate   Freedom of speech  not freedom of action  needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings  Speech has no meaning in itself  only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action  which is why it needs to be free  Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver  not the speaker  the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech  especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech   As for being hateful or hurtful to feelings  feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out  within each individual person  outside of the control of a speaker  Whilst a speaker s intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda  those emotions are created by the recipient  for good or ill  as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party  We are not our brothers keeper   It is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions  with reason  so that they don t take action that becomes the source of objective harm  Speech is not action or cause of action  that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech  internally as well as externally,0,articl fail discuss one form democraci oper greater good direct democraci peopl govern peopl direct democraci t fail achiev good major although noth perfect behav woefulli minor not accompani learn reason go includ compass howev reason person would awar show compass other also includ one receiv end part wisdom unto other would other unto howev direct democraci would better repres democraci peopl involv selfish vice tend better cancel noth perfect better use wors therefor encourag peopl australia urg govern direct direct democraci start creat uncensor anonym onlin forum reason debat feed public sentiment back govern suppos repres sentiment along associ educ program expert advis govern also present expertis peopl australia alreadi pay basic facil everi australian adult contribut forum reduc work hour allow particip freedom speech not freedom action need restor australian peopl instead chill discuss punish speech arbitrarili interpret hate result hurt feel speech no mean interpret particularli subsequ action need free even interpret speech receiv not speaker speaker no control receiv interpret respod speech especi word multipl interpret even parti understand speech hate hurt feel feel subject creat autonom act within individu person outsid control speaker whilst speaker intent may trigger emot recipi act certain way achiev particular agenda emot creat recipi good ill part normal function human not respons extern parti not brother keeper therefor vital teach peopl manag emot reason t take action becom sourc object harm speech not action caus action alway perform recipi depend interpret action speech intern well extern

hot  dry summers  mild cool wet winters  and the ocean temperature is a little colder  So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter  unless you are a hardcore     minutes from a beach  is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful  It s also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish   Brisbane   slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself   there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast  which are separate cities  Brisbane itself has a kind of  city beach  thing on the Brisbane riverfront area  but it s not really much of a place to swim  The climate is subtropical   generally very warm and agreeable   Canberra   inland city in the  mountains   with no ocean coastline and no beaches  Climate is generally quite cool  Very poor option for a beach lover  but a lovely city otherwise   Darwin   has beaches  but you really can t swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles  this applies generally in the tropical north   There is a sheltered  waterfront  area you can swim in that s very popular with locals and tourists alike  They also have a wavepool there  The climate is tropical   easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long  But yeah  your options will be limited and in general you d be better off with access to a pool   Hobart   has some beaches I assume  but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go  Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life   Melbourne   has beaches  but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay gulf so the surf is poor  You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches  The climate is marine coastal   some very warm and sunny days in summer  but more erratic weather in other months  It s probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is  Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular   Perth   like Adelaide  has suburban beaches all along its western side  and like Adelaide  has a Mediterranean climate  Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf  They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think  Some may argue  but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go   weather  surf  ease of access  Although Adelaide is very comparable close  moreso than a lot of people think    Sydney   has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean   but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded  which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways  parking access  crowds  etc   The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach  Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere  so  being   minutes from a beach  is much less attainable than it might seem  The weather is subtropical like Brisbane  but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers  You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags  That said  it s hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact   that s not without reason  They are stunning  and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture lifestyle in Sydney   So those are the capitals major cities  Adelaide  Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about  You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places  Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city  but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around    Perth  tour of general suburban coastline      Sydney  tour of several most popular beaches      Adelaide  Henley Beach     Adelaide  Brighton Beach     Adelaide  Grange Beach     Adelaide  Glenelg Beach     Adelaide  Glenelg Beach      Adelaide  Semaphore Beach     Adelaide  Aldinga Beach     Adelaide  Christie s Beach     Adelaide  Sellick s Beach     Adelaide  Maslin Beach       I couldn t find a good general tour video  but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety    Melbourne  St Kilda  Brighton      Gold Coast  Surfer s Paradise      arguably one of the nation s best  or best known  beaches  but a lot more than   minutes away from Brisbane  Gold Coast is its own distinct city  but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot  All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments    Darwin  Waterfront      very limited area you can actually swim  but it is literally almost always    C   Hobart  Nutgrove Beach      realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK   but very beautiful   However  you might want to consider some smaller regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within   minutes of the beach  I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state   NSW   Byron Bay  Coffs Harbour  Wollongong  Newcastle  QLD   Gold Coast  Sunshine Coast  Noosa  Mackay  Airlie Beach  Bundaberg  Yeppoon  SA   Ceduna  Port Lincoln  Moonta Wallaroo  Port Elliot Victor Harbor  Robe  Emu Bay   TAS   Bicheno  Coles Bay  VIC   Apollo Bay  Torquay  Lorne  Warrnambool  Sorrento  Bell s Beach  Geelong  Sale  WA   Margaret River  Bunbury  Albany  Broome  Esperance  Shark Bay  There are many others  These are mostly quite small places   accommodation will possibly be cheaper  but work will likely be much harder to find,1,gon

I would encourage everyone to read the AAT decisions in question before they leap to any conclusions  In  the XRGY decision   for example  the human trafficking allegations were given serious consideration  But the allegation came from ASIO and the AFP declined to prosecute him for the crime  From       In the absence of a criminal conviction the decision maker should rarely find that the conduct which would constitute an offence has occurred       The task of ASIO is a different task to that of adducing criminal guilt  It is the AFP that is best placed to investigate  charge and refer to the Director of Public Prosecutions cases of people smuggling  In the Applicant s case  it has not done so        If the Tribunal were to prefer or put more weight on the ASIO material than the AFP material  such an approach would raise Constitutional separation of power issues   Given the above  it wasn t really possible for the AAT to treat the allegations any other way  This is trial by media  essentially   I haven t looked for the Saki decision  but the minister s comments may well be accurate  that the AAT didn t properly consider the likelihood of reoffending  Easy to say in retrospect  of course  but even so  it s not evidence that the direction is a problem  just its application   I know Dutton  and possibly others here  think we should be able to apply extra judicial punishment to non citizens  Serve your time and then piss off home  Untested allegation  Too bad  get out  But not only is this a textbook authoritarian approach  and not only does it compromise our international obligations including those against non refoulement   discussion here   there s also the fact that the international community could start doing it to us  Deporting all their hardened criminals to our shores for us to deal with  It s a trick that ultimately goes against the interests of the Australian community even if it s emotionally satisfying,0,would encourag everyon read aat decis question leap conclus xrgi decis exampl human traffick alleg given seriou consider alleg came asio afp declin prosecut crime absenc crimin convict decis maker rare find conduct would constitut offenc occur task asio differ task adduc crimin guilt afp best place investig charg refer director public prosecut case peopl smuggl applic case not done tribun prefer put weight asio materi afp materi approach would rais constitut separ power issu given t realli possibl aat treat alleg way trial media essenti t look saki decis minist comment may well accur aat t properli consid likelihood reoffend easi say retrospect cours even not evid direct problem applic know dutton possibl other think abl appli extra judici punish non citizen serv time piss home untest alleg bad get not textbook authoritarian approach not compromis intern oblig includ non refoul discuss also fact intern commun could start us deport harden crimin shore us deal trick ultim goe interest australian commun even emot satisfi

Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it s a fake  The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce   Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren t usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed  then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image  which is the part that ties it to being porn  is questionable  It s like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations   Really  I don t understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent   The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can t trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable  you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably  or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react  unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis   The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that  Even if deepfake porn is produced  it s likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics  so once again  I m unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes   It s easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge   The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason  rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone  subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions  so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical  Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don t have enough resources to manage them completely  let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list   Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today  particularly fear and paranoia  yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear  How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it  The ends don t justify the means,0,would career ender even embarass fake abil creat fake make even like see fake sinc easier produc sinc connect person gener face peopl t usual embarass career end imag face distribut known presenc fake mean rest imag part tie porn question like alleg no support evid joke multipl interpret realli t understand paranoia unsupport alleg unless societi accept unsupport alleg truth punish basi guilti proven innoc preval fake misinform simpli mean t trust superfici present thu respons materi question work harder find truth order react reason dismiss propaganda not react unless like sound subject emot dribbl mouth without object basi purpos porn sexual excit usual exagger characterist facilit even deepfak porn produc like accentu person sexual characterist unsur object harm thing go prohibit era accept authent deep fake reject fake easier someon ignor critic judgement forc everyon not criticis judg issu deepfak porn one subject emot respons need moder reason rather object harm usual involv physic action someon subject hurt feel not necessarili object harm everyth tend impact subject emot attempt address everyth world result hurt feel reduc complex address object harm might even practic object harm themself must triag t enough resourc manag complet let alon ad subject hurt feel burden creat even longer list subject emot heart mani law craft today particularli fear paranoia yet govern use fear deterr attempt suppress distribut materi say lead fear use fear wrong distribut deep fake porn right method use suppress end t justifi mean

NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the  unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government    On Wednesday morning  Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine  with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party    It s time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper   he said   Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor Greens coalition    It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally   Israel   to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS   Mr Leeser told The Australian   But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government    This is not an environmental party   he said   This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews     What is Adam Bandt advocating for    Labor MP questions Greens leader s announcement  Only five people supported the Greens motion  including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie  while    MPs voted against it   Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives  Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not  just a symbolic move     It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza   he said   It is a concrete step towards peace     As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week  there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition   Mr Bandt said the  scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping        people     A health system has been destroyed  There are mass graves in hospitals  Aid has been blocked  Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink    He warned that a  human engineered famine  was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that  amounts to collective punishment of these people    Mr Bandt said that Labor s credibility was also on the line  declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you  recognise just one side     Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine   he said   Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu   Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting  un Australian values   Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion  arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community    Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer   Mr Watts said     Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace   he said    Wedge politics only divides the community   he said   Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution   but the Greens aren t serious  They prefer slogans to policy  A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other     On the question of recognition  we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace  Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard   he said   Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process  It could occur as part of a peace process    But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms  noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation   We see no role for them in this   he said   A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel s security     We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority   We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people    Mr Leeser  who spoke against the motion  told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded   End the occupation   Greens Leader calls for Labor to  take action  against Israel   This motion   sends the message that Hamas  violent terrorist attacks  its murders  its abductions  its gang rapes  and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable   he said   This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than     Israeli hostages    He also took aim at the Greens  saying that it was a party that promoted women s rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the  cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women  and  LGBTI people in the world    Mr Leeser  who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP  also said that anti Semitism had  become a central plank of Green philosophy     The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the   October terrorist attacks that passed this House on    October   even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza   he said   They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country    Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt  when directly asked on the ABC s Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state  would not answer   Reflecting on the Greens motion  Executive Council of Australian Jewry co chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed  how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to

Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday s budget went to Labor held electorates  sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition  Labor allocated      billion for    new priority infrastructure projects       billion of which went to Labor seats  according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review   Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats  Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to       billion over    years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states  The bulk of the new money  about      billion  went to    new projects in western Sydney  Among the cash splash was      million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay  A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the      billion    year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline   Advertisement Overall  NSW got      billion for    new road and rail projects with       billion allocated to Labor seats  About      million was given to Coalition seats and      million for projects that run over multiple  mixed electorates  Queensland was allocated three new projects worth      million  The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth      million  A further     million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie   Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most  and were guided by them to assess priority   The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered  as well as in fast growing areas like western Sydney and south east Queensland   Ms King told the Financial Review   The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of  We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered   Just over half new projects were in Labor seats  though almost half of those      small projects worth about      million   were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats  The Territory s election is scheduled for August this year  In Tasmania  three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money   about      million of the      million  which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways  Big winner A further     million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP  Victoria received just over       million for three new projects  all of which were in Coalition seats  but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget  receiving    billion for    existing projects  That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the    year      billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers  third budget  almost    billion more than NSW  There is also      billion still unallocated in NSW  with many new projects currently in the planning phase  and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future  Across new and existing projects  Queensland was allocated      billion  while Western Australia received      billion  about    per cent of which was for WA Labor s signature Metronet train network  South Australia got      million for seven new projects  just    million of which went to Labor seats  The bulk of the money   about      million   went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo  Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to  bail out  Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs   It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia

A private consulting firm handed almost     million in aged care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money  delivered a    page final report and issued legal threats   The saga of Miles Morgan Australia s involvement in the  Future Fit  turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care  where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem   It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor general  Rona Mellor   Miles Morgan Australia  MMA  is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from      by Barbara Macnish  a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer  Lakshman Gunaratnam  a former Deloitte Australia partner   Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December      and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year   Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter  Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle  Leveraged Pty Ltd   Miles Morgan Australia s involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May       when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program   Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers  Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for      million   The government approved but  without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia  the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network  had  a deep understanding  of the needs and a  strong working relationship with the Department     This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department s requirements   the submission prepared for Colbeck says    This procurement was through a direct approach  one supplier  of MMA under an existing panel arrangement    Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission  which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice  the contract notice for the      million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an  open tender    That contract was later revised up to more than    million  The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract   Within months of winning the contract  MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the  capability  for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined  Instead  some

The attorney general  Jaclyn Symes  said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police  granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them   Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed  regardless if they are actually innocent  As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain  the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them   Once in the justice system  mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty  Until recently  innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action  but this new legislation appears to block that avenue  meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations   I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes  however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation  which may also be false  in advance of a judgement of guilt   The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations   In our system of justice  the costs of making allegations is borne by the state  however the cost of defense  including defending their reputation  against allegations is usually borne by the defendant  Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation  Without that option  the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt  based merely on allegation  Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails  the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict   Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations  this is not prescribed   Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser  but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser  allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused  regardless of the outcome of the court   Crimes need to be objective harms of import  because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only  regardless of their guilt  which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence  To also punish people  regardless of their guilt  as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous  however many crimes are just that  based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms   I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity  so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement   I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage  We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence   If a crime is of sufficient import and true  then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward  then we need to address why that is  not develop knee jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings    This perception that victim survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits   If an allegation is truthful  why would a defamation action succeed  Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can t be carried out  that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia   However  I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice,0,attorney gener jaclyn syme said reform would protect victorian made report polic grant complet immun alleg perpetr tri bring defam

Paywall  The NSW Coalition s most senior law officer  Alister Henskens  has been accused of displaying a  dereliction of duty  after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill   In an extraordinary move  Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government s new laws  which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders  would pass without consultation   The changes follow a string of high profile alleged domestic violence offences  including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month   Shadow attorney general Alister Henskens said the Coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by Thursday  Shadow attorney general Alister Henskens said the Coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by Thursday Credit  Louise Kennerley  The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens  the shadow attorney general  argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws  He later said he had seen the government s press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy   Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition  and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor s laws   However  Henskens  push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack   Greenwich said he had been in parliament for  five premiers  five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments   and he had never seen a proposal with  such disrespect to stakeholders in this space     I ve never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill  or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don t want to consult with them   Greenwich said   They want to rubber stamp something they haven t ever seen  But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned  if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space  the crossbench will pick it up    Leong said the former Coalition government had    years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures  such as shelters for women fleeing partners   She said Henskens  attempts to ram through the bill smacked of  relevance deprivation    Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said    The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party   Hoenig said  Attorney General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that  all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state   Domestic violence support groups  including Say No to Violence  had also asked that the new laws be  considered properly  before being passed   On Tuesday  the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community  At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences  which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault  strangulation  kidnapping or coercive control   There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender s release in the Supreme Court   A requirement for magistrates and judges to consider  red flag  behaviour such as animal cruelty  stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced  while courts will need to consider the

The NSW government is withholding more than half a billion dollars a year in waste levies collected from local councils  a NSW parliamentary committee has heard    The levy is also costing the state government money because it s incentivising northern NSW councils to send their landfill across the border to Queensland  according to evidence presented to a NSW Standing Committee investigating the sustainability of local government    The United Services Union says instead of the levy being used to help councils manage waste more sustainably  it s being hoarded in state government coffers    The union says the government collects around      million a year in waste levies from councils  but only invests      million of that back into waste management initiatives and pockets the rest     The NSW Government is withholding money collected from local councils and their communities to the tune of      million a year through the waste levy   General Secretary Graeme Kelly said ahead of his appearance before the committee on Friday    NSW losing out to Queensland   The USU says the levy collected would be significantly more if funds collected by the state government were reinvested into new local and regional landfill sites  particularly in northern NSW where most councils are now sending landfill waste over the border to Queensland     Waste being transported to Queensland is at a cost to ratepayers and results in no waste levy being collected in some regions   Mr Kelly says     The waste levy is supposed to be an environmental measure  but it s become a perverse incentive for some councils to dodge the levy by dumping waste in Queensland     Most of the councils on the north coast from Coffs Harbour to the Tweed Border use contractors who are technically robbing NSW councils and taxpayers by not paying the levy     Broader financial crisis   The USU argues the waste levy is just one symptom of the broader financial crisis facing local government in NSW and is also calling for an end to rate pegging  echoing  concerns raised by Local Government Professionals NSW     The USU wants to see the rate peg abolished as part of a broader reform package to secure the long term financial sustainability of the local government sector     Scrapping rate pegging won t solve all the problems facing councils overnight  but it s an essential first step   Mr Kelly said    The United Services Union represented workers in local government and represents every town and community in the state and every job within local government up to and including General Manager,0,nsw govern withhold half billion dollar year wast levi collect local council nsw parliamentari committe heard levi also cost state govern money incentivis northern nsw council send landfil across border queensland accord evid present nsw stand committe investig sustain local govern unit servic union say instead levi use help council manag wast sustain hoard state govern coffer union say govern collect around million year wast levi council invest million back wast manag initi pocket rest nsw govern withhold money collect local council commun tune million year wast levi gener secretari graem kelli said ahead appear committe friday nsw lose queensland usu say levi collect would significantli fund collect state govern reinvest new local region landfil site particularli northern nsw council send landfil wast border queensland wast transport queensland cost ratepay result no wast levi collect region mr kelli say wast levi suppos environment measur becom pervers incent council dodg levi dump wast queensland council north coast coff harbour tweed border use contractor technic rob nsw council taxpay not pay levi broader financi crisi usu argu wast levi one symptom broader financi crisi face local govern nsw also call end rate peg echo concern rais local govern profession nsw usu want see rate peg abolish part broader reform packag secur long term financi sustain local govern sector scrap rate peg t solv problem face council overnight essenti first step mr kelli said unit servic union repres worker local govern repres everi town commun state everi job within local govern includ gener manag

Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living  Right now  she says  it is grim  and the housing crisis is at the root of it    You actually can t have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn t begin and end with housing  There is a deep  almost intractable despair   says Huntley  director at the strategic communications consultancy    Degrees East   The way people in her focus groups see it  she says   it doesn t matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down  or unemployment is up or unemployment is down  doesn t matter if it s a pandemic  not a pandemic  GFC or not a GFC  housing is a horror show    To an ever increasing extent  they see just one solution to their woes  cut immigration    They re like   We can t get ourselves out of this mess  therefore  we just need less people lining up for the rental property  less people trying to buy the house  Just less people    says Huntley   It s not such a new sentiment  though perhaps not previously so keenly felt  Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake  One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration   Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of    of these polls  conducted over the past six years  in a speech to parliament in March   Of course  Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in       famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being  swamped by Asians   Two decades later  after having lost her seat in the lower house  she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in       warning Australia was being  swamped by Muslims    In her March    speech  though  Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing  transport  health  education and other services  In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters  she claimed vindication  The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were  out of control     Was I right   she asked her fellow senators   You d never admit it  but yes I was   she said   It s hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long  The large majority of people want it cut  the great majority of the political  media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns   It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is a good thing  enriching the nation culturally and economically  Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act  leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia s immigration intake   Ian Lowe  emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University  can attest to that   Lowe was president of the country s pre eminent environmental organisation  the Australian Conservation Foundation  for    years until        During that time  he tells  The Saturday Paper   he advocated for the ACF to  prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure   The organisation was reluctant to take a position  however  on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be  taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson type racist comment     Cutting migration will make housing cheaper  but it would also make us poorer   The boost to government budgets is enormous    So the ACF avoided the issue  and it still does today   as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues   Meanwhile  Australia s population is on track to grow to about    million people   an increase equivalent to the combined current populations

He claimed that by  rebalancing the migration program   the Coalition would free up almost        additional homes in the first year  And well over         homes in the next five years    How this number was calculated  he didn t say  It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year  and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts   There is  in any case  reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home  During the Covid lockdowns  when Australia s borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero  prices continued to rise rapidly   According to modelling from the Grattan Institute  high migration does have some effect on housing costs  For every         above the long term average  rents rise about   per cent  Thus last year  by this estimate  Australia s record number of migrants probably pushed them up about   per cent   But  says Trent Wiltshire  Grattan s deputy director of migration and labour markets   asking rents have been rising    per cent a year  So it s a factor  but certainly not the driving factor    Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs  Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton  says Wiltshire   it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around         over the next four years  compared to the existing skilled migration intake    Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be     billion    With all due respect to Grattan  it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton s proposed cuts would be  because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall   What is clear is that for more than a year  Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia  and blaming the Labor government for the influx   This is simply not true  policy experts say  In fact  the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic   In the      budget  the last before the pandemic  NOM was forecast to be about          a little above the long term average  Instead  because of Covid  it plunged close to zero for two years   When the borders reopened  the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers  and particularly overseas students  to return    In         the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost   numbers   says Abul Rizvi  a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration   Policies such as unlimited work rights for students  fee free student and working holiday maker applications and a special Covid visa    The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences  So it did  Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could  but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality  It was like an unregulated gold rush   says Rizvi   The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government s shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit  says Phil Honeywood  chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia   In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada  which provided support for overseas students to stay   Scott Morrison told students to just go home   says Honeywood    That caused incredible damage to Australia s reputation as a safe  welcoming study

Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war  CAH  war crimes  and being told by very   very  Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G   which the ICC neglected to indict upon  suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists  do control the world   I m really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor s in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University   Conceptually  the idea that no state s leaders can be immune to prosecution from  jus cogens  offences is one that  even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US  holds water  We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law  that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law   which  in lay speak  means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal  The sovereign state cannot make it legal  which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept  because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence  The ICC sought  in a sense  to manage this by targeting individuals  the ICJ focuses on disputes between states  because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes  Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views  and makes use of  the different types of jurisdiction in international law   So we re getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory  In practice  the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court s authority on political grounds  where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance  not justice  The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit  For one  in trying to give an appearance of balance  Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state  As flawed as those leaders are  it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered  entirely  to politics in doing so  The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement   The ICC s investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel  as part of their investigations  It was arranged and never followed through on  Under the ICC charter  if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence  then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over  It is of course  doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self investigate on these grounds   but a court like this  must  be strict in its observing of protocol  if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense  The US  Russia  and China all already are in opposition to the concept  which is     of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council  International cooperation has died for less  see also  League of Nations  and US non involvement    This brings us to Australia  The opt out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US  and this situation   though it s hard to see Bibi coming here  It should exist  Dutton  on a diplomatic front  is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it  But there s a wider argument  which Dutton is missing  and that s not the first time I ve had to say this about the LOTO   Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis  It is right to view   October as unacceptable  It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they re too smart for propaganda  as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people    It is   not   right  however  to carry out collective punishment under international law   Australia s correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government  despite unhelpful  performative  and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike  Reaffirm ally status with Israel  Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law  Hold it to account as we would  any  liberal democracy that falls short of the standards  whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan s Law as our left so ably does    But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned  the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing      after      Mohammed Deif  Yiyha Sinwar  and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag      There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over  these cowards who make America s Koch brothers look lovely and secular  That has to change  and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not  it makes a mockery of the whole system  Saying as such should be without controversy   So  like many things  Dutton is a little bit right  but it s purely by accident  he doesn t know why or how  and it s grossly offset by how wrong he is too,0,proven correct respect actual ju cogen offenc play war cah war crime told onlin

I drink espresso so don t really have the issue with milk  but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge  For the most part Soy milk is non perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities  perhaps at a discount  and stored because it has a longer shelf life    I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co  Barista Soy Milk which claims it is  Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance  and has  consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art  costs        for    x   Litre cartons  so       per litre    A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around       and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away  Doesn t it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn t throwing away stock    Perhaps I m over simplifying it  but it seems obvious that if an inner city cafe became known for selling soy  almond or oat milk lattes for      less than dairy milk lattes  it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing  I don t know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day  perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads  it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost    I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don t know what I m talking about a  I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b  I have a machine at home  I load in the beans that I like  I push a button  it grinds them and espresso comes out  that s as complicated as my coffee existence gets  so I m definitely not a customer of yours and I don t really care what the cost of a coffee is  I m simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes  I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that s hardly the case now,0,drink espresso t realli issu milk curiou soy almond milk incur higher charg part soy milk non perish stock could purchas higher quantiti perhap discount store longer shelf life quick scan altern dairi co barista soy milk claim uniqu blend coffe freak lab coat geek unparallel tast perform consist textur canvass perfect latt art cost x litr carton per litr litr full cream dairi farmer milk cost around could store short period may point need thrown away t make sens encourag peopl choos soy almond milk offer lower price long run cafe save money t throw away stock perhap simplifi seem obviou inner citi cafe becam known sell soy almond oat milk latt less dairi milk latt would attract custom want kind thing t know balanc plant base versu dairi milk latt order would given day perhap vast major still seek dairi non dairi drinker still minor given theme thread sound like peopl would will trek block even switch dairi plant base felt reason deal not far beyond cup coffe cost add coupl caveat angri cafe owner tell t know talk not know talk b machin home load bean like push button grind espresso come complic coffe exist get definit not custom t realli care cost coffe simpli ask soy milk latt incur addit fee make sens actual make cheaper dairi base latt get mani moon ago soy almond milk probabl bit exclus hardli case

revisited before the election     Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will   says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler   That and nothing else    Most of the    people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials  Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials   Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus   In November last year  Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children s application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth  Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky s ruling    Australian citizenship has to mean something   says Tinkler   Being a child has to mean something too  And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth  then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen    In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court  Greg Barton  professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University  said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria  AANES   or from current circumstances on the ground  to repatriate Australian women and children    AANES  together with the United States  desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated  There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused   Barton said   In       then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp  Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that  had it not been for the Covid    pandemic  Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children   In October       Labor s Home Affairs minister  Clare O Neil  announced a group of four Australian women and their    Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales  mostly in Western Sydney   Last week one of those women  Mariam Raad      pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State  a terrorist organisation   Raad  who is on bail  will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to    years in prison  She is the only person among the    people repatriated in October      to face court   Kamalle Dabboussy  chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils  AFIC   says the    who were repatriated in October      have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney  He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy s return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north east Syria    It wasn t a headache  I can take a Panadol for that  It was a fucking migraine  a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister s office  and the pain of it hasn t gone away     They are getting on with their lives  getting engaged with their communities  playing sports  and as far as national security goes  they re doing exactly what they said they would do  which is cooperate with Australian authorities   says Dabboussy,0,prime minist anthoni albanes shelv indefinit plan repatri australian women children current strand detent camp manag

Not really  The gist of Michael West s article is what s known as the doctrine of command responsibility      It comes about when senior leaders did not  order  war crimes  but they  knew or should have known  and stopped them  This applies to military leaders  of course  which is what McBride was upset about  But it applies to political leaders  too   since ultimately  in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership    Just think of it this way  Let s imagine that our intervention in Afghanistan had been a stunning success  Let s say that today   because of Australia s intervention   the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy  Do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit   Of course  So   if you re to take the credit when things go well under your leadership  you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly    That s the doctrine of command responsibility  As the wikpedia article quotes     The Prosecutor v     Delali      et al     the  elebi i case   first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that  had reason to know   article       means that a commander must have  had in his possession information of a nature  which at the least  would put him on notice of the risk of     offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether     crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates    Returning to the article  a link within it      notes that then Defence Minister Stephen Smith was in      made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days  There is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims   in fact he publicly denied them    The Minister for Defence is in overall control of the ADF  Under the doctrine of command responsibility  Stephen Smith may be responsible for war crimes    Anthony Albanese was a member of Cabinet at this time  Given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time  Albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them  However  over the period of ALP government         he held a variety of roles  including Deputy PM under Rudd   and so it would be arguable when  where or whether he could be held responsible  Nonetheless he was a member of a government where the ADF was suspected to be committing war crimes  and the government rejected action on this,0,not realli gist michael west articl known doctrin command respons come senior leader not order war crime knew known stop appli militari leader cours mcbride upset appli polit leader sinc ultim democraci militari act direct civilian polit leadership think way let imagin intervent afghanistan stun success let say today australia intervent countri peac stabl liber democraci think member govern day would want take credit cours take credit thing go well leadership will take blame go badli doctrin command respons wikpedia articl quot prosecutor v delali et al elebi case first consid scope command respons conclud reason know articl mean command must possess inform natur least would put notic risk offenc indic need addit investig order ascertain whether crime commit commit subordin return articl link within note defenc minist stephen smith made awar alleg war crime publicli within day no indic took measur whatsoev investig claim fact publicli deni minist defenc overal control adf doctrin command respons stephen smith may respons war crime anthoni albanes member cabinet time given war crime alleg air media time albanes not claim unawar howev period alp govern held varieti role includ deputi pm rudd would arguabl whether could held respons nonetheless member govern adf suspect commit war crime govern reject action

PAYWALL     Plumbers  bricklayers  cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia s housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government s list of core occupations for its new skills in demand visa  despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas   As part of the government s December      migration strategy  which aims to halve net migration from         within two years  Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the  core skills occupations list    Under the current draft  tradespeople including bricklayers  painters  roof tilers  stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as  targeted for consultation   rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list   A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included  which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was  bizarre  given the industry s  mammoth task  of building     million homes by        In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia  Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages  would be a failure     Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building     million homes with supporting infrastructure  all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list   Wawn said on Tuesday    Bricklayers  cabinetmakers  stonemasons  painters  plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the  maybe  list  If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis  this needs to change    A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final  core skills occupations list     Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year   the spokesperson said   Home Affairs Minister Clare O Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa  which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage  as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least          indexed annually  Successful applicants could have their visas approved in    days  and have their length of stay doubled to four years  with potential for permanent residency   Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall      Prime Minister Anthony Albanese s   failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need  and now we see him making it even worse   she said    There is a clear contrast between the Coalition  who as   Opposition Leader   Peter Dutton said in the budget reply  will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue  versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue    Earlier this month  the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council s State of the Housing System      report found the government s target of building     million homes by      would fall short by more than         due to building industry constraints  complex planning processes and lack of land   In December  O Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program  but  we need to make sure it is not a free for all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships    However  the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration  with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to         this financial year and         next year and         in the

Gas runs out  It produces ongoing waste  It s sourced from a small number of places  with a small number of providers  The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies  national  state  or corporate  change  Supply can be cut off   Renewables don t run out   that s their whole point  They don t  in general  produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use  or at least it s significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear  The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances  And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies  and even in house by businesses and individuals  it s a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt hour  even on initial equipment costs  It s not controlled by a small number of providers  It doesn t need large scale and separate infrastructure  of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid  to be maintained  It doesn t need things continually physically transported in order to operate  And it s a lot harder to cut off supply when more end consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally   The only two reasons to go with non renewables are     price per watt hour  and     politics from people who want to make all the money and or have control over fuel supplies  And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non issue  especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste management costs from every aspect of the operational process   Previously  the first reason held economic sway  and it made sense to go with non renewables  I m not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time  But it s becoming far less of one  and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has  over time,0,ga run produc ongo wast sourc small number place small number provid price rise incred sharpli polici nation state corpor chang suppli cut renew t run whole point t gener produc ongo wast multipl type point product point use least significantli less fossil fuel nuclear product equip either highli recycl like abl becom technolog advanc renew power produc thousand compani even hous busi individu lot harder price anyth go per watt hour even initi equip cost not control small number provid t need larg scale separ infrastructur kind significantli differ exist electr grid maintain t need thing continu physic transport order oper lot harder cut suppli end consum produc least need sourc rest extrem local two reason go non renew price per watt hour polit peopl want make money control fuel suppli first reason rapidli approach non issu especi factor total cleanup wast manag cost everi aspect oper process previous first reason held econom sway made sens go non renew not point finger peopl made decis time becom far less one increasingli like swing renew larger scale alreadi time

Paywall   The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector  It is not  It is a powerful  cashed up lobby group promoting the interests of wind  water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in Australia   Last month  the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards  airport lounges and lifts in prime Sydney and Melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking Australia s future  It is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the Coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election   Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Ted O Brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix  Intermittent  disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid  Gas also would be a crucial part of the mix  principally because of its agility to ramp up or down  compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources   Yet the renewables sector has bought none of it  It regards the election of a Coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight  Implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out  It would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory    It is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt   not just temporarily  but for good   wrote Giles Parkinson  the editor of Renew Economy  the sector s equivalent of the China Daily   Giles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions  network capacity  connection delays  social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition   At the end of the week  the announcement that the NSW government would pay Origin up to     m to keep the Eraring Power Station operating for two years beyond its planned      retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal  The Victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with EnergyAustralia  the owner of Yallourn  and AGL  which operates Loy Yong A  Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system  The theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited   The Australian Energy Market Operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next    years  named somewhat optimistically as the Statement of Opportunities  AEMO said it had been advised of  numerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects   meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between      and        This would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events  or blackouts as most people would call them  It gets worse  The new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate Bowen anticipated    months ago  and they need to get connected to the grid  Building       km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected  Planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget   There is no good news for Bowen or the sector in the AEMO report  Project EnergyConnect  the interconnection between NSW and South Australia  was regarded as the most straightforward high voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory  Yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until July      at the earliest  That will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the Torrens Island B and Osborne power stations shut  In NSW  delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected  and Victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission   Even if we accept AEMO s optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline  this is hardly the fast track transition the government promised  In October       Bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government s    per cent clean electricity target by      would require the installation of        solar panels a day     million in total  by the end of the decade  It would require a   megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every    hours  each as high as Crown s One Barangaroo tower in Sydney  About       km of new high voltage

The debt burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births  deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances   Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry s services   Pallas met with one firm last week  according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations  and pitched the idea as a  limited term contract  in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads  licensing and registration arms   a deal due to expire in the     s   The industry source  who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests  said the treasurer was  hoping to close any deal by the end of the year    A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria s bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth  death and marriage certificates   A cabinet minister  also speaking on the condition of anonymity  confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births  Deaths and Marriages through the private market    It can probably be done better   the minister said   The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer   Births  Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high profile issues in recent years  particularly during the pandemic  when its offices were closed  it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered   Asked if the agency was to be privatised  a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership    Victoria s Births  Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised  but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services    The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation  but a joint venture partnership   Just seven months ago  the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about    billion by June       That expected financial hole more than doubled to      billion in the May   state budget   The same budget papers forecast Victoria s debt to rise to        billion by June       In simple terms  the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a     million daily interest bill   Labor s primary vote has also plummeted below    per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier  according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month  The survey found two thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt   But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks  The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government s management of debt and government agencies  Meanwhile  the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service   Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December  the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed   Researcher Charlie Joyce  from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute  said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria    Daniel Andrews campaigned in      against privatisation   Joyce said   He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission  A further re embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which  I think  frankly  is already fraying    Joyce said while Victoria s debt levels were an important consideration  his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often  short term gain for long term pain     For something like Births  Deaths and Marriages  this is a government service that handles very sensitive information  A private owner that cuts costs on security   cybersecurity in particular   could quite quickly run into trouble    It would  also  be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost    Birth  death  marriage or change of name certificates start from        in Victoria  but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive  There were        registered births in Victoria last year         marriages and        deaths   The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June    last year was        million  according to the Department of Government Services  most recent publicly available annual report   The same report states that Births  Deaths

statement also revealed Melbourne s public high rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model   When VicRoads was partly privatised in       Pallas refused to label the development privatisation    This is not privatisation in anybody s language   the treasurer said at the time    We re always looking to see how we can drive better services  better performance  but we will never divest the ownership of assets    The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting      billion into Victoria s coffers   Under the VicRoads deal  the state maintains ownership of the service  the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs

Bit off topic  but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW   the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats  and I m curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place    I don t think it s feasible for a cross harbour seat to be created  so I think North Sydney  especially as it s one of the federation seats  and Sydney aren t going anywhere   I think if one of the northern seats will disappear  the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah  Mackellar can t move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non contiguous  so I think it will become a thinner  beach oriented seat  Bradfield  Bennelong  and North Sydney could be pushed east  the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly   Then again  the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible  which complicates things yet again    As a side note  I dislike the practice of non geographical names for electoral divisions  even though in this case  Warringah is a geographical name   I m no advocate for the American numerical system  and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes  be    unneccesarily    specific   however using the geographical centre of the seat  as the NSWEC does  leads to fewer absurdities  Lake George  for instance  existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade  and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk   If it s on the south side of the harbour  then I think it will be messier  Wentworth is another      seat  so I could see its boundaries moving south  Alternatively  Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler  it is oddly enough the newest of the three   but I don t think that would please anyone  I can t imagine the AEC removing Albanese s seat either  Possibly Barton could be partitioned   Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter  Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson  demographics trending away from the party in both  by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter  but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush,0,bit topic realli interest see propos boundari nsw eastern half metro sydney set lose one mayb two seat curiou side harbour take place t think feasibl cross harbour seat creat think north sydney especi one feder seat sydney t go anywher think one northern seat disappear one make geograph sens warringah mackellar t move north hawkesburi non contigu think becom thinner beach orient seat bradfield bennelong north sydney could push east latter could feasibl cross middl harbour similar manner state seat manli aec want retain aborigin place name possibl complic thing yet side note dislik practic non geograph name elector divis even though case warringah geograph name no advoc american numer system recognis geograph name sometim unneccesarili specif howev use geograph centr seat nswec lead fewer absurd lake georg instanc exist within seat werriwa decad warringah possibl move north replac mackellar no longer cover middl harbour creat anoth pointless quirk south side harbour think messier wentworth anoth seat could see boundari move south altern sydney could theoret split wentworth grayndler oddli enough newest three t think would pleas anyon t imagin aec remov albanes seat either possibl barton could partit also interest see happen hunter labor seem intent shore hunter expens paterson demograph trend away parti draw maitland cut upper hunter geograph constraint port stephen lake macquari could well lead arrag would make illinoi mapmak blush

Wow  what an experience  More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown  No greeting or instructions  so we grabbed our own table and waited  Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table  Menu collected and choices decided  went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made  Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive  Underwhelming at best  Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers  Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread  A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain  Again  I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently  Bacon was ordinary  hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect  hence the two stars  One for each egg  Do yourself a favour  go around the block and take advantage of Maccas or Hungry Jacks  At least you know what you will get there,0,wow experi hour wait breakfast probabl need take blame order extravag menu choic bacon egg hash brown no greet instruct grab tabl wait fifteen minut later obviou probabl need get menu none tabl menu collect choic decid went counter order still no greet apart coupl grunt whilst coffe made order provid hour wait food arriv underwhelm best packag butter place balsam glaze make experi much better sticki finger butter toast experi hole bread bread request salt pepper met look distain trust chef qualiti establish season food suffici bacon ordinari hash brown flavour three month old oil poach egg near perfect henc two star one egg favour go around block take advantag macca hungri jack least know get

I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately  my experience was quite disappointing  especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes         Korean Chicken     The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting  The seasoning was bland  and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for  It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste         Lemon Squid     The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations  The squid was overcooked  resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy  Additionally  the lemon sauce lacked balance  being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out         Pricing and Portions     One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes  The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served  The portions were notably small  leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent  Overall  while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant  the food quality  particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes  did not meet expectations  The pricing  coupled with the small portions  further detracted from the overall dining experience  I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers,0,recent visit butter factori unfortun experi quit disappoint especi regard korean chicken lemon squid dish korean chicken korean chicken dish lack authent flavor expect season bland textur chicken not crispi hope seem like either undercook not prepar proper techniqu achiev signatur korean chicken tast lemon squid lemon squid dish also fell short expect squid overcook result rubberi textur difficult enjoy addit lemon sauc lack balanc overli sour without complementari flavor round price portion one signific drawback experi butter factori price combin portion size dish quit expens consid qualiti quantiti food serv portion notabl small leav feel unsatisfi not get good valu money spent overal ambianc butter factori pleasant food qualiti particularli korean chicken lemon squid dish not meet expect price coupl small portion detract overal dine experi hope restaur take critic account improv offer provid satisfi dine experi custom

My brother took me here for lunch  which was nice of him  Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was  It took    men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope  Once inside  the waitress seated us at our table  which was in the middle of the room  This would n t be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant  aside from some rando in shorts at the bar  who left soon after  The decor is nice  The waitress served our table water  took our orders  then went and made our drinks  The food seemed to take a while  which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve     us   I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever  No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came  Top tier  served and presented well and tasted better than it looked  About the best a bundy bogan can ask for  The waitress serving us  the only waitress there  also made our cocktails  She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered  which  as somewhat of a mixologist myself  I could appreciate  Overall  I had a pleasant dining experience  and I would definitely come here again on someone else money  Between entrees  mains  and drinks  we racked up      although we were given   back in change for some unknown reason  It was really mysterious  Another mystery was what was upstairs  They had chairs parked in front  so you could n t easily get up there  but I think next time  I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding,1,brother took lunch nice first impress heavi slide entri door took men small goat tow open rope insid waitress seat us tabl middl room would n t unusu except two custom restaur asid rando short bar left soon decor nice waitress serv tabl water took order went made drink food seem take thought odd consid number peopl serv us guess kitchen staff catch whatev kardashian whatev no complaint food drink final came top tier serv present well tast better look best bundi bogan ask waitress serv us waitress also made cocktail took pride craft uniqu hous special offer somewhat mixologist could appreci overal pleasant dine experi would definit come someon els money entre main drink rack although given back chang unknown reason realli mysteri anoth mysteri upstair chair park front could n t easili get think next time tri sneak uncov whatev secret hide

An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients  no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over   yrs  Northern Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts and I believe this place is as authentic as you ll get in the CBD  Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth  perfectly cooked noodles  and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments  There are no bean sprouts because there are n t supposed to be bean sprouts   that s a Southern thing  Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills  Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion  Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner  My only qualm is that the donut was n t the best one I ve had it needed to be crispier and not as dense   And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho  Definitely order one per bowl   it s not a sharing serving size at all,1,institut hardwar lane specialis hanoies style vietmanes pho boast natur ingredi no msg broth recip remain unchang yr northern vietnames pho differ southern counterpart believ place authent get cbd dish rich flavor broth perfectli cook noodl balanc fresh herb condiment no bean sprout n t suppos bean sprout southern thing northern pho not complic no frill pilot decid opinion pho thin nail simplic msg free make clear broth winner qualm donut n t best one need crispier not dens mayb bigger serv size bowl pho definit order one per bowl not share serv size
