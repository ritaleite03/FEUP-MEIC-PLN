"Well I'm not really confident that we'll see mismanagement on the scale of Turnbull's Hydro 2.0... especially given several of the issues with building Hydro 2.0 came from stuff they couldn't reasonably have predicted in the first place. 

This the real reason why we have an energy crisis and why nuclear won't be built here anytime soon. The media actively criticises any investment in building assets or infrastructure and if there are any snags in the project, the criticism flows even harder. No consideration for any aspect of the project beyond the price tag. And the writer of this article thinks they're being clever by drawing a spurious inference between Snowy 2.0 and the FMIA program, which ultimately amounts to ""uhhh watch out for unforeseen liabilities!""

"I don't think cost is the issue for most people as to whether they use public transport or not.

It's have a frequent, reliable and pleasant service that gets them from A to B in a reasonable time. They're willing to pay for that.

Quite often the A or B aren't on the network, and if they are, the service is not frequent, reliable or pleasant. People aren't willing to pay for that. The outer suburbs of Melbourne are an unfortunate example of this. Nobody's walking 1.5km to stand at a bus stop in the sun or rain for a bus that comes once every 45 minutes and is often late or cancelled so they can then walk 1.5km at the other end. They'll just drive instead, if they can possibly afford it.

Even with the much better trains in Melbourne, they're often late or cancelled due to trackworks, whether building new tracks and stations or fixing up old lines. You can't plan, ""Let's visit the city this weekend and go to Vic Market,"" you might find yourself taking a 90 minute bus journey instead of a 25' train journey, and falling over every time the overcrowded bus lurches to a stop or swings around a corner.",0,i do not think cost is the issue for most people as to whether they use public transport or not it is have a frequent reliable and pleasant service that gets them from a to b in a reasonable time they are willing to pay for that quite often the a or b are not on the network and if they are the service is not frequent reliable or pleasant people are not willing to pay for that the outer suburbs of melbourne are an unfortunate example of this nobody s walking km to stand at a bus stop in the sun or rain for a bus that comes once every minutes and is often late or cancelled so they can then walk km at the other end they will just drive instead if they can possibly afford it even with the much better trains in melbourne they are often late or cancelled due to trackworks whether building new tracks and stations or fixing up old lines you cannot plan let us visit the city this weekend and go to vic market you might find yourself taking a minute bus journey instead of a train journey and falling over every time the overcrowded bus lurches to a stop or swings around a corner,not think cost issue people whether use public transport not frequent reliable pleasant service get b reasonable time willing pay quite often b not network service not frequent reliable pleasant people not willing pay outer suburbs melbourne unfortunate example nobody walk km stand bus stop sun rain bus come every minute often late cancel walk km end drive instead possibly afford even much good train melbourne often late cancel due trackworks whether build new track station fix old line not plan let u visit city weekend go vic market might find take minute bus journey instead train journey fall every time overcrowd bus lurch stop swing around corner

"I've got friends from the US,  Canada and France that also commented on how prevalent it was here. 

I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 

I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.

Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.

The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.

 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least 72 hours in advance. The only exception was if  someone called in sick. The Idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call.",0,i have got friends from the us canada and france that also commented on how prevalent it was here i am and have never had a full time job well technically i have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason did not have their contacts renewed i have been in my current job for years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed like i worked hours last financial year but because it was not hrs a day days a week every week i do not get permanent also as someone whose been casual for a while other things have changed like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you then ringing around staff to see whose available it is shifting the risk cost of business from the employer to the employee the law has not caught up with technology i have talked to people who did my job more than years ago casual was not a thing because most people did not have mobile phones so they paid people to be on call they do not anymore because everyone has a mobile so if i do not answer they will try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in i have brought that up with the union and again they do not care i want at a minimum what a friend in the us told me that they were proposing in his state cannot remember if it went through they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps what they call casuals of hrs a shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least hours in advance the only exception was if someone called in sick the idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call,get friend u canada france also comment prevalent never full time job well technically month month contract anyone take day reason not contact renew current job year get denied permanency base fact shift irregular annoy thing union rep agree like work hour last financial year not hrs day day week every week not get permanent also someone whose casual thing change like long shift begin schedule something place literally get call client say yeah today ring around staff see whose available shift risk cost business employer employee law not catch technology talk people job year ago casual not thing people not mobile phone pay people call not anymore everyone mobile not answer try someone else eventually someone pickup agree come bring union not care want minimum friend u tell propose state not remember go propose minimum notice period temp call casuals hrs shift schedule person assign least hour advance exception someone call sick idea make business go back put people call

"These attacks on the ICC are pure hypocrisy. International law is not just a tool to be selectively applied when it suits the US and its allies. The US and EU was insistent on the former Yugoslav countries co-operating with and handing over suspected war criminals. The US did not object when it issued an arrest warrant for Putin.

The ICC charging and trying war criminals is of the international rules based order, whose protection is supposedly the cornerstone of Western diplomacy, especially when it comes to convincing countries to sanction and condemn Russia. But now the Americans are not just attacking the court but considering sanctioning the court for literally doing it's job.

As for Dutton he overestimates how many people outside of the conservative (and some non-conservative) media and political elite care about Israel, and outraged by this.

At the end of his prison sentence, he is deported because he never became an Australian citizen.

In my view, he is Australian, he has no ties to that foreign country, can't even speak the language well. He has no family left in that country.

Should he be deported? Sure he's not a nice bloke, but isn't he Australia's problem?

"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is “either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament”.**“

Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid the [worsening police pay crisis.](

In what is threatening to ­become the biggest schism ­between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in a [bitter stalemate with the Police Association]( over a push to ­introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.

Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn’t incur ­additional costs or require extra resources.

“I don’t think you’ll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,” Mr Carbines said.

“That process continues and while that process is under way, it’s not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.”

But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association ­announced a “breakthrough”.

Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O’Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month’s state budget.

Mr O’Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee’s work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force’s annual wages bill.

He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety – a claim vehemently denied by the police union.

“The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,” Mr Carbines said.

“The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined.” Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. “When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can’t explain his mistakes,” he said. “Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.”",0,anthony carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning which has drawn criticism that he is either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament police minister anthony carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid the worsening police pay crisis in what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade victoria police remains locked in a bitter stalemate with the police association over a push to introduce nine hour shifts for frontline officers appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on tuesday mr carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government victoria police and the police association of victoria in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model which would also see officers work nine day fortnights providing it did not incur additional costs or require extra resources i do not think you will find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties being victoria police and the police association they are the parties to the deed an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator mr carbines said that process continues and while that process is under way it is not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere but the state government later confirmed mr carbines had indeed signed the deed on december last year a day after the police association announced a breakthrough mr carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by nationals mp danny o brien a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month s state budget mr o brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee s work because chief commissioner shane patton who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine hour shifts has claimed it would add bn to the force s annual wages bill he has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to police off the beat and undermine community safety a claim vehemently denied by the police union the impression i was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate mr carbines said the deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined shadow police minister brad battin slammed mr carbines who is also minister for racing when you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police of course he cannot explain his mistakes he said anthony carbines is either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament either way he is failing those he pretends to represent,anthony carbine fire admit confuse line question drawn criticism either totally incompetent intentionally mislead parliament police minister anthony carbine force admit mislead parliament amid worsen police pay crisis threaten become big schism force state decade victoria police remain locked bitter stalemate police association push introduce nine hour shift frontline officer appear parliamentary inquiry tuesday mr carbine emphatically deny signatory deed state government victoria police police association victoria agree implement new rostering model would also see officer work nine day fortnight provide not incur additional cost require extra resource not think find signature piece paper relate party victoria police police association party deed agreement commit work matter assistance leadership mediator mr carbine say process continue process way not appropriate government minister intervene interfere state government later confirm mr carbine indeed sign deed december last year day police association announce breakthrough mr carbine later admit confused line question national mp danny brien veteran public account estimate committee probe month state budget mr brien say police pay deal critical committee work chief commissioner shane patton vehemently oppose introduction nine hour shift claim would add bn force annual wage bill also warn would force closure police station take police beat undermine community safety claim vehemently deny police union impression get question ask somehow sign deed determine outcome oblige party way negotiate mr carbine say deed simply set parameter party agree dialogue discussion certainly not task sign deed directs confirm way enterprise agreement determine shadow police minister brad battin slam mr carbine also minister race minister focus horse race police course not explain mistake say anthony carbine either totally incompetent intentionally mislead parliament either way fail pretend represent

"Lets be clear - calling out actual racism is not divisive, it is pointing out actual division. Classic conservative playbook approach to quash movements for equality.

However I feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns. Of course some people in Australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics. But for those that aren't who aren't also progressive, it is just alienating

Labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism, which IMO is usually economic inequality. People in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that (eg if you are poor, why does it make sense to vote Yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough)

In this sense, this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems. You can't let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem.

This is of course not the actual motivation of Price, who doesn't give a flying F about ordinary people when it actual comes down to it",0,let us be clear calling out actual racism is not divisive it is pointing out actual division classic conservative playbook approach to quash movements for equality however i feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns of course some people in australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics but for those that are not who are not also progressive it is just alienating labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism which i am going to is usually economic inequality people in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that eg if you are poor why does it make sense to vote yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough in this sense this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems you cannot let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem this is of course not the actual motivation of price who does not give a flying f about ordinary people when it actual comes down to it,let u clear call actual racism not divisive point actual division classic conservative playbook approach quash movement equality however feel like progressive label whole country racist diminish return course people australia racist may worse certain demographic not not also progressive alienate label everyone racist often mean blind true force underlie racism appear racism go usually economic inequality people economic hardship easily convince circumstance result tribe race easily play eg poor make sense vote yes referendum perceive someone else get leg tough sense type rhetoric divisive work class need solidarity overcome real economic problem not let either side politics tell ordinary people problem course not actual motivation price not give fly f ordinary people actual come

"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.

Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 

**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.

The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 

When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed [International Tribunal]( Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ([ICTY]( 

This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 

The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.",0,you are quite wrong on all fronts which is consistent for your take on this matter but i will explain again genocide is a jus cogens offence as such the australian state cannot punish it it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that is it south africa in a bold move to distract anc critics at home when electoral woes were headed their way sought to make a case for it in the icj and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since our obligation under the convention is for the prevention though not the punishment some objective research would have illustrated why and i will have to explain it for you because of the pesky objective part the first jus cogens trial for which our own doc evatt was not involved but he was in ungar fun fact was the nuremberg trials here the new german government did not punish the old nor did the us take the lead a tribunal was convened with a panel of allied judges when the rwandan genocide went to trial it was at a un backed international tribunal similarly when the serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the yugoslav wars it was via a un international tribunal icty this is not coincidence it is a function of a jus cogens offence because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it in other words you can only have an international legal trial the right thing has happened the icj was involved australia s best bet is to let that play out and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators do not say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic lest someone take them seriously,quite wrong front consistent take matter explain genocide jus cogens offence australian state not punish solemn duty prevent south africa bold move distract anc critic home electoral woe head way seek make case icj rule ignorantly wilfully interpret since obligation convention prevention though not punishment objective research would illustrate explain pesky objective part first jus cogens trial doc evatt not involve ungar fun fact nuremberg trial new german government not punish old nor u take lead tribunal convene panel ally judge rwandan genocide go trial un back international tribunal similarly serbian leadership go trial genocide commit yugoslav war via un international tribunal icty not coincidence function jus cogens offence opposed application jus commune domestic court no state permit derogation norm nor validly punish word international legal trial right thing happen icj involved australia best bet let play make sure politically legally ignorant senator not say kind stupid shit normally reserve horrifically unqualified redditors topic l someone take seriously

"I learned some hard lessons, not so much financially, but with my grandfathers quality of life.  We had to move him to a better facility.

- do the other residents look happy in that environment or bored, plonked in front of cartoons in the common room.
- check out the activities board. If they don't have one, run. If the activities are all children's games... also run.
- does the facility have in house chefs making delicious fresh food, or do they simply warm up bland pre-packaged frozen meals. 
- will the facility allow residents to have their own mini fridge in their room, access to internet and phone.
- observe staff interactions with other residents when inspecting facilities. You can tell very quickly if it's a warm and caring relationship between them.
- ensure any cultural/religious needs can also be met.

"This is an old post I’ve shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 

Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.

Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.

For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.

Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.

The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.

Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the '50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.

South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).

"Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.

In my opinion, if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public, you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process: that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation. We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.

If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.

I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.

I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.

Isn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?",0,bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics in my opinion if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation we could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building if it was not an emergency years ago or even year ago it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling it is simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime events will still happen like the stabbing of people at bondi it is a tragedy but it does not represent an emergency i believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative i also do not understand how the high court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee jerk and compromised solution surely the high court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point is not the high court also bound to minimise harm or die on the hill of point of law,bail try predetermine guilt use profile characteristic opinion want minimise deprivation freedom maximise security public find measure accomplishes without predetermine outcome judicial process mean detention secure hotel conventional freedom provide except leave premise protection detail accuse home prevent take advantage situation could even combine court accommodation separate part build not emergency year ago even year ago not national emergency crime steadily fall simply not possible get zero crime whilst try minimise crime event still happen like stab people bondi tragedy not represent emergency believe stem idiotic legislation indefinite detention equally idiotic lack legal alternative also not understand high court suddenly strike legislation year inaction result compromise security public government rush implement emergency legislation knee jerk compromise solution surely high court could advise government likely challenge sufficiently advance permit well think legislation put place strike legislation put public risk especially since indefinite detention nothing do point not high court also bind minimise harm die hill point law

"I grew up in Australia and live in the US now. There’s a lot of untrue stereotypes in this thread except for a few which are for the most part true (bearing in mind that it’s a population of over 300 million people and there are vast regional differences.)

Americans don’t dry clothes on the clothesline and will always use a dryer. 

Americans use air conditioning all the time so need to dust quite often. And then in the winter central heating will blow dust everywhere too so the dusting never stops. 

Americans tend to use more disposable plates and cups, but it tends to be lower income people who do this. But that said - I would agree that most Americans are generally less conscious of the environment. Paper towels for everything. Disposable wipes. Disposable mops like Swiffers. Disposable dusters. 

And lastly- this is a town by town basis but it seems like recycling is half hearted at best. I recycle at home but honestly I’m skeptical the bottles and glasses are cardboard I sort into different bins is actually recycled.

"Mining:    

>The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning. The one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for 10 percent of your operating costs, but it’s available for existing facilities as well as new ones. And it doesn’t have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production.    



Super Tax Breaks:    

>They probably don’t involve the same degree of economic costs. They have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality, and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain, which is fraying. And so, the big one, the biggest hole is super tax breaks. So, they’re costing 45 billion a year.

>It’s about 2 percent of GDP. They’ll pretty soon cost more than the age pension. They’re obviously not very well targeted. Half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households. I put these in two buckets. There’s the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it’s not going to hurt you too much.

>And that is title limits on pretax contributions. It’s raising the tax rate on some of those pre-tax contributions through division 293 tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool. And if you do those, there’s 3 or 4 billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end.

>And then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age 60, you’re not going to pay any tax on your earnings. You basically had to check out of the tax system and that’s costing Australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year. And that’s not really sustainable in the long term.    



NDIS:   

>Yeah, look, and look, this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that’s growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that’s growing slower than the economy, you know, you know, you’ve got something you’ve got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we’re willing to pay.

>At the outset of the NDIS, there was a really important you know, piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to, into employment and that’s part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself. Was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve? [they lean towards it being largely erroneous].       



Housing:   

>I think that’s a great question. And the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we haven’t built enough. That’s why housing in part is so expensive. It’s not the only factor, but it’s certainly a factor that we have some control over. And if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy.    



Healthcare:   

>As the Commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well, you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports, you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government. And so, you see you know, we, we’ve seen historically, the Commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care.    

>And leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals. Or in the case of the NDIS, you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state-based settings. And as the states have less money to spend, they’re going to be less cooperative in, in, in those conversations.

>And I think this comes back to the fact that Australian Federation wasn’t well designed on the tax side. We’ve got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states, downstream services sitting with states, but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the Commonwealth.



Job Seeker:

>Look, it’s a really tough one, because I think it’s clear that we need the rise. So, JobSeeker for a long time has been well below the level that I think allows people to be empowered to go and find work as well as survive.

>If they’re on that payment for a while, we’ve seen increases for originally from the Coalition and then in Labor last year. That mean that the payments gone up by 45 a week in real terms. Our position had always been it needed to rise by at least 100 a week. So, we’re still 55 dollars a week away from that.

Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.

My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 

Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 

We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 

And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 

Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.

Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable. Like the fight they had about cleaning the exterior with a pressure washing company. Owners didn't want to... Strata told them we are doing it either comply and pick a company yourself or we will and you'll be fined, there mold growing lol",1,i am in a strata as a renter and to be honest i am okay with it during the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard owners responsibility and also the external wall that the driveway is on strata responsibility and i am talking inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it my landlord owner decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they would not be fixing the wall to my courtyard that it was fine and likely would not happen again while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side this caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course mold checks one of the other issues i had was my courtyard is ft below the road level and i only had the one drain which was not effective to stop water pooling so that absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes i think that is what they called them were under the water so the water only had one way to drain into my apartment strata ripped away all the walls affected to redo the flashing including in the courtyard had more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue took the lovely workers days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it we had a very similar flooding incident this year strata were all over me to check the flashing was working there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just check via little holes they fixed the same week and look while it was unprecedented flooding it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to xs in mths end up inches under water and there was time between each event to fix it clearly as it was done in days total others can i guess be absolute shit shows but not all are edit to add ours is a corporate style strata no owners are on their board or whatever it is they are a management of the property style set up owners can bitch at them ask them to do repairs to common area but owners have to accept anything really they say unless totally unreasonable like the fight they had about cleaning the exterior with a pressure washing company owners did not want to strata told them we are doing it either comply and pick a company yourself or we will and you will be fined there mold growing lol,stratum renter honest okay really bad flood situation year back apartment flood due no flashing external wall private courtyard owner responsibility also external wall driveway stratum responsibility talk inch deep apartment remove access loungeroom kitchen also inadequate drainage courtyard help make even bad accord guy xame fix landlord owner decide unprecedented flooding would not fix wall courtyard fine likely would not happen stratum prepping fix driveway side cause argument two technically stratum would rip apart internal wall ensure flash fixed course mold check one issue courtyard ft road level one drain not effective stop water pool absolutely no flash courtyard water far weep hole think call water water one way drain apartment stratum rip away wall affect redo flash include courtyard drain added courtyard take owner court pay repair part wall new drainage stratum saw rightly unreasonable not fix part issue take lovely worker day include repaint inside wall pull apart fix similar flooding incident year strata check flash work nothing come apartment even send inspector check via little hole fix week look unprecedented flooding still absolutely not okay apartment x mths end inch water time event fix clearly do day total others guess absolute shit show not edit add corporate style strata no owner board whatever management property style set owner bitch ask repair common area owner accept anything really say unless totally unreasonable like fight clean exterior pressure wash company owner not want stratum tell either comply pick company fin mold grow lol
"One of Australia’s most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world’s third-largest population of sheep – behind China and India – but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don’t have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems’ capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.

The Coalition’s usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government’s Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country’s transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.

A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don’t work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow – ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn’t rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?

The battery strategy sets out a “vision” over the next decade, in which Australia becomes “a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition”.

We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers’ know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!

The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan’s Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing “impurities” such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.

Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government’s battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated – note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn’t stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.

The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.

Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.

There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.

The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government’s battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a “battery breakthrough” initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on “high-value battery products” that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an “Australian-made battery precinct” in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.

The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US’s anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.

Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the Rudd–Gillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.

Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government’s battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.",1,one of australia

"Moved in earlier this year. Can't recommend it highly enough. They are always built near trains, trams and bike lanes and you get a free GoGet membership thrown in so if you need a car, you go get one and only pay for usage. Obviously some people need their car daily so obviously if that's a deal breaker then it's not for you (but as you say, looking to ditch your car so it's a good fit).

Community is fantastic, everyone is conscientious, super supportive and really active in sharing things, giving away furniture etc.

Build is high quality, excellent material choices, apartments are really quiet. Doors are heavy and use a gasket design to seal so the outside world disappears when they are shut. Very comfortable in here.

Excellent amenities, green everything, good quality appliances. Every apartment has a planter with built in irrigation. 

There's storage cages on the roof, bike storage, lots of new washing machines, beautiful roof views and close to everything good.

Obviously NG use a ballot system so you can't just roll up and put money down. I'll be here for a long time. If you were looking for a way to avoid the shitshow that is the real estate industry, this is a good way to go about it. NG are very open and communicative about the build process all the way through, nice people.

"As a niche-interest protest party, the Greens care little about the impact their hardline positions would have on ordinary Australians. The undergraduate and destructive stance taken by G[reens leader Adam Bandt]( on the October 7 terrorist attacks by[ Hamas against Israel]( is proof enough of the harm the far-left party poses to [Australia’s community cohesion](

The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but, as outrageous as the anti-Israel stand is, it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government. When allowed to get close to the levers of power – as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government, and with a balance-of-power position in the federal Senate today – the [Greens are exposed]( for the wreckers they are.

The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy – most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups – has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation’s environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.

Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government’s corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.

The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government’s wider agenda. This includes housing, where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner-city seats. Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties. For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression. The Greens, once again, have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions.",0,as a niche interest protest party the greens care little about the impact their hardline positions would have on ordinary australians the undergraduate and destructive stance taken by g reens leader adam bandt on the october terrorist attacks by hamas against israel is proof enough of the harm the far left party poses to australia s community cohesion the inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass anthony albanese but as outrageous as the anti israel stand is it is only part of a bigger threat that the greens represent to our national identity and good government when allowed to get close to the levers of power as they did in de facto coalition with the gillard labor government and with a balance of power position in the federal senate today the greens are exposed for the wreckers they are the albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the greens its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight good policy most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups has been put on ice to appease the greens changes to the nation s environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world something business supports labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the greens whatever one may think about the albanese government s corporate subsidy agenda the greens will only make it worse the greens have pledged to use their balance of power position to frustrate the government s wider agenda this includes housing where by focusing on renters the greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner city seats voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties for all the high ideals expressed before the last election the teals have failed to make an impression the greens once again have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions,niche interest protest party green care little impact hardline position would ordinary australian undergraduate destructive stance take g reens leader adam bandt october terrorist attack hamas israel proof enough harm far leave party pose australia community cohesion inflammatory detour foreign policy calculate embarrass anthony albanese outrageous anti israel stand part big threat green represent national identity good government allow get close lever power de facto coalition gillard labor government balance power position federal senate today green expose wrecker albanese government yet prove substance stand green record date one eager cut deal shy away fight good policy recently legislation give certainty offshore gas industry discourage unjustified lawfare attack protest group put ice appease green change nation environmental law delay difficult find sensible way allow development protect natural world something business support labor already say delay introduce legislation bn package production credit hydrogen producer critical mineral process announce federal budget allow time negotiate green whatever one may think albanese government corporate subsidy agenda green make bad green pledge use balance power position frustrate government wider agenda include housing focus renter green outflank federal government electorally inner city seat voter must heed lesson minor party high ideal express last election teal fail make impression green show action make politics economy poorer intervention

"> continuing the Allan Labor Government’s priority to make Victoria a safer place for women and children and work to end the tragedy of deaths of Victorian women at the hands of men.

How can domestic violence be a valid priority when more women and children die on the roads, if indeed death is the primary determinant of the program?

I'm assuming they mean women in Victoria rather than Victorian women (from the Victorian era) none of whom are still alive.

It's deceitful to blather on about number of deaths of women in domestic violence as justification, when more women die in other arenas, in order to support a program that aims to reduce domestic violence of a wide range of forms including raised voices.

Surely the focus should be on the worst triaged objective outcomes, not subjective hurt feelings; and on men who kill, not profiling all men for the actions of a minority.

Didn't we ban gay conversion therapy only to now implement a generic Men's Behaviour conversion therapy?

"TL:DR 

Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 

Centrelink are useless. 

Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum’s advocate. 



I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It’s a nightmare!

Here are my pro-tips!

*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 

From memory it cost about $3500. 

They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 

*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 

You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 

Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 

I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 

I’ve just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let’s not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 

*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 

Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it’s surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 

Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 

Be your mum’s advocate. That’s the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It’s enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 

That said, I’ve found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced.

"It’s not difficult to understand.

Nuclear power is expensive, it might stack up against coal but it’s absolutely hopeless compared to pv solar.

Off shore wind is just absurd and the Bowen should be accounted for his stupidity in wanting it.

Power needs to be generated as close to the use as possible.

Storage from pumped hydro and batteries is still cheaper than the alternative now.

An electric vehicle fleet would have enough storage capacity for over a day and we have never had that ability before.

Ex American warships have 150mwh reactors and have a 20 year lifespan after they are decommissioned. 

Dock one in Newcastle or wherever we need some base load. 

Might be worth considering?

We use just under 11kw per capita per day. 
That’s it. 

So 10  solar panels rated at 440 watts will produce more than the country needs.

They last 30 years.
So install one solar panel per person every other year and we would have enough power. 

So realistically with the taxes we pay, no household should be paying for power. 

It just one big con job.

Thankfully I live off the grid and wouldn’t consider connecting to it, it’s just not worth the nonsense. 

Watching everyone power go off. 
It’s a joke. The power should never go out .

Companies are quoting enormous amounts for the ignorance of people. 

I have 21kw batteries and 12 kw of solar and it cost half what I have been quoted for half the capacity so where the money goes is anyone’s guess. 

It’s just money, no one is going to make it if we have cheap power.

"Yes we pay on time, not in full in a single payment in Feb but with one of the instalment arrangements offered because Feb is an expensive time of year for us with back to school costs, family birthdays, and hot on the heels of Christmas and summer holidays.

"# Australian Education Union

**Members**: 50,000

**Status**: Ongoing

Victorian TAFE teachers began [industrial action ]( last month after the state government failed to put a “fair and reasonable pay and conditions offer” on the table.

On Friday, members voted to further escalate their fight by taking stop work actions in June and July, before escalating to a 24-hour work ban on August 21. They also won’t attend meetings.

Australian Education Union Victorian president Meredith Peace said for too long the concerns of TAFE teachers have been “neglected” by the government and TAFEs.

“TAFE teachers are burning out due to excessive and unsustainable workloads … This is unacceptable, particularly as Victoria deals with ongoing skills shortages, that require urgent intervention from the state government,” she said.

Other actions to be taken by members include stopping work for the duration of any campus visit by a state Labor MP, bans on performance of Excess Teaching Duty Hours and work related to auditing and professional development and recording student engagement or attendance.

Staff are also refusing to respond to management inquiries other than inquiries related to OHS matters, teacher’s entitlements, or student welfare.

That's why Labor ran on housing reform in 2013, 2016 and 2019. Yet, Australians did not believe the housing crisis existed until it hit the cities. So now we're in a fucked position. Covid LNP money printing added to the problem, too, in the way of increasing interest rates.

Strictly focusing on detached homes as the only options mean transport and services struggle to scale and serve the new areas, this has been a known problem forever as well.

"The article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people.

Direct democracy can't fail to achieve the good of the majority, although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason. I was going to include compassion, however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end: it's part of the wisdom in ""do unto others as you would have others do unto you"".

However, direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out. Nothing is perfect, but better is more useful than worse or the same.

Therefore, I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy, to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment; along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it; basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum; and reduced working hours to allow them to participate.

Freedom of speech, not freedom of action, needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings. Speech has no meaning in itself, only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action, which is why it needs to be free. Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver, not the speaker: the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech, especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech.

As for being hateful or hurtful to feelings, feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out, within each individual person, outside of the control of a speaker. Whilst a speaker's intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda, those emotions are created by the recipient, for good or ill, as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party. We are not our brothers keeper.

It is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions, with reason, so that they don't take action that becomes the source of objective harm. Speech is not action or cause of action: that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech, internally as well as externally.",0,the article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people direct democracy cannot fail to achieve the good of the majority although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason i was going to include compassion however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end it is part of the wisdom in do unto others as you would have others do unto you however direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out nothing is perfect but better is more useful than worse or the same therefore i encourage the people of australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of australia who are already paying for it basic facilities for every australian adult to contribute to the forum and reduced working hours to allow them to participate freedom of speech not freedom of action needs to be restored to the australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings speech has no meaning in itself only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action which is why it needs to be free even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver not the speaker the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech as for being hateful or hurtful to feelings feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out within each individual person outside of the control of a speaker whilst a speaker s intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda those emotions are created by the recipient for good or ill as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party we are not our brothers keeper it is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions with reason so that they do not take action that becomes the source of objective harm speech is not action or because of action that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech internally as well as externally,article fail discuss one form democracy operate great good direct democracy people govern people direct democracy not fail achieve good majority although nothing perfect behave woefully minority not accompany learn reason go include compassion however reason person would aware show compassion others also include one receive end part wisdom unto others would others unto however direct democracy would better representative democracy people involve selfishness vice tend good cancel nothing perfect well useful bad therefore encourage people australia urge government direction direct democracy start create uncensored anonymous online forum reason debate feed public sentiment back government suppose represent sentiment along associated education program expert advise government also present expertise people australia already pay basic facility every australian adult contribute forum reduce working hour allow participate freedom speech not freedom action need restore australian people instead chill discussion punish speech arbitrarily interpret hateful result hurt feeling speech no meaning interpretation particularly subsequent action need free even interpretation speech receiver not speaker speaker no control receiver interprets respods speech especially word multiple interpretation even party understand speech hateful hurtful feeling feeling subjectively create autonomously act within individual person outside control speaker whilst speaker intent may trigger emotion recipient act certain way achieve particular agenda emotion create recipient good ill part normal function human not responsibility external party not brother keeper therefore vital teach people manage emotion reason not take action becomes source objective harm speech not action action always perform recipient depend interpret action speech internally well externally

My take out from this described shambles is that the coalition are meaningfully engaged in this debate and we can expect a much argued and defensible policy that has had plenty of darts thrown towards it internally.

"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:

Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.

Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.

Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.

Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.

Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.

Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.

Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).

Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.

So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:

[Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)](

[Sydney (tour of several most popular beaches)](

[Adelaide (Henley Beach)]( [Adelaide (Brighton Beach)]( [Adelaide (Grange Beach)]( [Adelaide (Glenelg Beach)]( [Adelaide (Glenelg Beach)](  [Adelaide (Semaphore Beach)]( [Adelaide (Aldinga Beach)]( [Adelaide (Christie's Beach)]( [Adelaide (Sellick's Beach)]( [Adelaide (Maslin Beach)]( - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)

[Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton)](

[Gold Coast (Surfer's Paradise)]( - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.

[Darwin (Waterfront)]( - very limited area you can actually swim, but it is literally almost always 32°C

[Hobart (Nutgrove Beach)]( - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.

However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:

NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle

QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon

SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 

TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay

VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale

WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay

There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.",1,just going to do the major cities in alphabetical order here adelaide has

"What is causing this problem is nothing more than government policy. 
The problem is created by government policy and can only be solved through changing laws. 

We are governed by political interests that undermine economic interests. 
It’s like asking the children to run the kindergarten. 

All of these essential services and healthcare, aged, doctors, teachers, are all ultimately being paid for by taxpayers. 

Increasing their salaries only increases our inability to afford it. 

There is no doubt that we need to raise the minimum wage to meet the demands of the cost of living. 
$30 per hour is not unreasonable.

However you would currently after a 38 hour week receive 
$930 a week. 

At $29 per hour you would be getting $905 . 

If we just paid a basic minimum wage of $550 per week and a flat tax rate of 47 percent then we could actually pay people to look after our elderly at $20 per hour. 
Far more affordable. 
They would be receiving $907 a week nett. 

Someone receiving $30 per hour would be on $1154 per week nett, hundreds more. But only $15 a week nett to the government in cost. 

People can then work 5 hours or 50 , we don’t spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset’s and everything little things they earn. 

You cut off hundreds of thousands of pages of red tape. 

Government departments should be running as they are all part of the same organisation, but they don’t. 
They have no idea how to cooperate with each other and work together towards a common cause. 

All fighting for their own patch of money and funding. 

Who yells louder and can wangle their political agenda.

"I personally would go for Mitcham. Have a friend that lives next to the Burwood highway. It’s weirdly inconvenient, pretty much like living in Bundoora I suppose, where you have a tram line right next to you, but going into the city with it takes forever so you might as well not bother. Trains over trams at all times. I think it’s faster to go to the cbd by trains from Mitcham comparing to by trams from Burwood East, although Mitcham is a fair bit farther away. 

Other than that, I think they are both good. You said Burwood highway but mitcham has Whitehorse Rd through which is pretty much a highway with service roads so it probs won’t give you a lot of quiet tranquility either. The only dealbreakers is trains vs trams for me.

"Great drive for the most part. There are some stunning beaches north of Sydney; try to stop by the one just north of Tea Gardens (a town). Byron Bay and Coff's Harbour are nice, though I hear they're swarmed with tourists these days.

There are beautiful bushwalks in Southeast Queensland. I like the Mt. Mee Lookout walk, but that can take 5 hours and requires at least moderate physical fitness. There are so many others of varying length in the area. That region also has the Glasshouse Mountains, Australia Zoo, and the Blackall ranges.

Somewhere near Isis I think there's a ""Canadian"" roadside diner. Could stop there if it's open and see how it compares to the real thing. Rockhampton has a pretty good zoo with free admission. Beyond Rockhampton there's a pretty boring stretch for about 4 hours before you get to Mackay.

Airlee Beach is not particularly impressive, but you'd have to pass through if you want to check out the Whitday Islands. Whitehaven Beach is consistently rated as one of the best and most beautiful in the world.

Two months gives you way more time than necessary to do that trip.

"I would encourage everyone to read the AAT decisions in question before they leap to any conclusions. In [the XRGY decision]( for example, the human-trafficking allegations were given serious consideration. But the allegation came from ASIO and the AFP declined to prosecute him for the crime. From 53:

>In the absence of a criminal conviction the decision-maker should rarely find that the conduct which would constitute an offence has occurred . . . The task of ASIO is a different task to that of adducing criminal guilt. It is the AFP that is best placed to investigate, charge and refer to the Director of Public Prosecutions cases of people smuggling. In the Applicant’s case, it has not done so. . . . If the Tribunal were to prefer or put more weight on the ASIO material than the AFP material, such an approach would raise Constitutional separation of power issues.

Given the above, it wasn't really possible for the AAT to treat the allegations any other way. This is trial by media, essentially.

I haven't looked for the Saki decision, but the minister's comments may well be accurate: that the AAT didn't properly consider the likelihood of reoffending. Easy to say in retrospect, of course, but even so, it's not evidence that the direction is a problem, just its application.

I know Dutton (and possibly others here) think we should be able to apply extra-judicial punishment to non-citizens. Serve your time and then piss off home. Untested allegation? Too bad, get out. But not only is this a textbook authoritarian approach, and not only does it compromise our international obligations including those against non-refoulement ([discussion here]( there's also the fact that the international community could start doing it to us. Deporting all their hardened criminals to our shores for us to deal with.

"While labour and materials are the biggest cost inputs into homes trades who work for domestic builders arent even on that much. 

High wages defenitely afflict high rise builders though especially in victoria. 

But what does my head in is the liberals are all over this new car tax and yet they introdiced GST on homes, then mainly labor state governments introduced developer levies, councils more charges. 

So we have liberals crying foul on a 15k impost on 4x4s but then the 150k plus in taxes from homes - 15bn odd per annum we dont say the same - what does this 150k do to the proce of all homes.

To my mind it is a bigger issue of justice and equality that homes are made more expensive by tax than 4x4s and i drive and holiday in 4x4s. 

Why is this not on the radar? Why can we go; congrats labor spending 2bn on supply while we milk 15bn back out as generous to prospective first home buyers.

"Out of the options you listed, Buller is the clear pick. It has a good lift network, good trails, good town, generally has decent conditions, and good transport options. It can get really busy especially on weekends, midweek less of an issue. 

Lake Mountain doesn't have any downhill skiing - cross country only (as well as snow play). It's also very low in altitude so unreliable for conditions - if you wanted to to go there to see snow you'd have to keep an eye on the weather and conditions as it may well be sloppy or bare.

Baw Baw can get decent snow but it's a very small area with short lifts and trails. It would be cheaper than Buller so there's that. I've never been there so can't say much more.

My favourite option in Victoria is Falls Creek - IMO it has the best variety of terrain, the best views, the best conditions, and less queues than Buller. However it is too far for a day trip. For 2 nights though I'd say it's worth it going to Falls Creek. It might be hard and/or expensive to get accommodation at this late stage though. Definitely worth the extra distance though if it's possible. 

Finally - if your visitors are coming from overseas, I'd question if going skiing here is really something they want to do here. If they're coming from a country where they already ski, it's unlikely to be better here. And if not, it's likely they can travel and ski somewhere where it will be cheaper and better than it is here. I'm not saying absolutely not to ski here - I do most years and enjoy it - but there's probably better uses of their time and money in Australia. I only ski here because I live here and that makes it easy.",1,out of the options you listed buller is the clear pick it has a good lift network good trails good town generally has decent conditions and good transport options it can get really busy especially on weekends midweek less of an issue lake mountain does not have any downhill skiing cross country only as well as snow play it is also very low in altitude so unreliable for conditions if you wanted to to go there to see snow you would have to keep an eye on the weather and conditions as it may well be sloppy or bare baw baw can get decent snow but it is a very small area with short lifts and trails it would be cheaper than buller so there is that i have never been there so cannot say much more my favourite option in victoria is falls creek i am going to it has the best variety of terrain the best views the best conditions and less queues than buller however it is too far for a day trip for nights though i would say it is worth it going to falls creek it might be hard and or expensive to get accommodation at this late stage though definitely worth the extra distance though if it is possible finally if your visitors are coming from overseas i would question if going skiing here is really something they want to do here if they are coming from a country where they already ski it is unlikely to be better here and if not it is likely they can travel and ski somewhere where it will be cheaper and better than it is here i am not saying absolutely not to ski here i do most years and enjoy it but there is probably better uses of their time and money in australia i only ski here because i live here and that makes it easy,option list buller clear pick good lift network good trail good town generally decent condition good transport option get really busy especially weekend midweek less issue lake mountain not downhill ski cross country well snow play also low altitude unreliable condition want go see snow would keep eye weather condition may well sloppy bare baw baw get decent snow small area short lift trail would cheaper buller never not say much favourite option victoria fall creek go best variety terrain best view best condition less queue buller however far day trip night though would say worth go fall creek might hard expensive get accommodation late stage though definitely worth extra distance though possible finally visitor come overseas would question go ski really something want come country already ski unlikely well not likely travel ski somewhere cheaper good not say absolutely not ski year enjoy probably well uses time money australia ski live make easy

"LCD backlights have an expected lifespan, typically measured in hours. It can be a pretty wide range of hours from 20,000 - 100,000 hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components, screen brightness & other settings, environment it was being used in, so on and so forth. Some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans (with lots of caveats).

How many hours per day did you use the monitor? What brightness level? Was the room it was in hot or humid? Did it get direct sunlight? Etc etc etc.  Multiply the amount of hours you used it by 4 years, take off a bunch for whatever conditions, and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor, then you can argue (per Australin consumer law) that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it isn't meeting the expected lifespan.

But if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor, you're going to have a much harder time arguing that point.",1,lcd backlights have an expected lifespan typically measured in hours it can be a pretty wide range of hours from hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components screen brightness other settings environment it was being used in so on and so forth some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans with lots of caveats how many hours per day did you use the monitor what brightness level was the room it was in hot or humid did it get direct sunlight etc etc etc multiply the amount of hours you used it by years take off a bunch for whatever conditions and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor then you can argue per australin consumer law that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it is not meeting the expected lifespan but if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor you are going to have a much harder time arguing that point,lcd backlights expect lifespan typically measured hour pretty wide range hour hour depend multiple thing quality component screen brightness setting environment use forth manufacturer advertise expect lifespan lot caveat many hour per day use monitor brightness level room hot humid get direct sunlight etc etc etc multiply amount hour use year take bunch whatever condition number get significantly expect lifespan monitor argue per australin consumer law despite warranty still valid return not meet expect lifespan rough estimate total hour use around expect monitor go much hard time argue point
"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.

Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.

Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.

The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.

The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.

It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.

The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.

Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it? The ends don't justify the means.",0,why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it is a fake the ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people are not usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image which is the part that ties it to being porn is questionable it is like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations really i do not understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent the prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you cannot trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis the purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that even if deepfake porn is produced it is likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics so once again i am unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes it is easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge the issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical objective harms themself must be triaged because we do not have enough resources to manage them completely let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today particularly fear and paranoia yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear how can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it the ends do not justify the means,would career ender even embarassing fake ability create fake make even likely see fake since easy produce since connection person generally face people not usually embarassed career end image face distribute know presence fake mean rest image part tie porn questionable like allegation no support evidence joke multiple interpretation really not understand paranoia unsupported allegation unless society accept unsupported allegation truth punish basis guilty proven innocent prevalence fake misinformation simply mean not trust superficially present thus response material questionable work harder find truth order react reasonably dismiss propaganda not react unless like sound subjective emotion dribble mouth without objective basis purpose porn sexually excite usually exaggerate characteristic facilitate even deepfake porn produce likely accentuate person sexual characteristic unsure objectively harmful thing go prohibition era accept authenticity deep fake reject fake easy someone ignore criticism judgement force everyone not criticise judge issue deepfake porn one subjective emotional response need moderate reason rather objective harm usually involve physical action someone subjective hurt feeling not necessarily objective harm everything tend impact subjective emotion attempt address everything world result hurt feeling reduce complexity address objective harm might even practical objective harm themself must triaged not enough resource manage completely let alone add subjective hurt feeling burden create even longer list subjective emotion heart many law craft today particularly fear paranoia yet government use fear deterrent attempt suppress distribution material say lead fear use fear wrong distribution deep fake porn right method use suppress end not justify mean

"I can’t really find any transcript of Tingle’s speech in which the context of the ‘racist’ quote was made, so it’s very difficult to judge the intent and meaning behind the comment.

The only bit I can find:

>“We are a racist country, let’s face it. We always have been and it’s very depressing,”

There’s no metric on what qualifies as a ‘racist’ country or not; but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation.

The treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre 1901

The fact the first Federal Parliament passed the White Australia Policy, a blatantly racist law which remained in law for 70 years, the majority of Australia’s existence up until this time

The practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation’s existence (again up until the 70s)

Fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today.

Different legislation for those living in indigenous communities (like NT alcohol laws) 

On a non political level (as her comment didn’t specifically mention politics only):

The vast vast majority of commercial TV and media featuring white faces. Today 1 out of 5 Australians are of Asian heritage (there’s more Australians of Asian heritage than Americans of black or Latino heritage) but you wouldn’t know it from watching Australian TV.

The national character and story being almost exclusively from a white Anglo Saxon perspective, with only fleeting mentions of a vague ‘multiculturalism’.

News media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite.

News media egging on race riots like Cronulla.

Tingle is right, racism is a big part of the Australian story. Australia may not be as racist as other nations, and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments.

"I was not born in Australia and I generally like to torch the cunts who were, but you protest far too much, I think. If you were talking about violent crimes committed against immigrants, I could understand it. That's not what you're talking about here - and frankly you're a little insulting, assuming that you are for real.

Australia's level of immigration has been far too high for several years without any commensurate expansion in infrastructure. Everyone settles in Melbourne or Sydney. This has created a very noticeable decline in living standards in terms of overcrowding - not just traffic, but in schools, hospitals, etc. A lot of people don't want any more of this and it's hard to blame them. The housing situation is unimaginably horrible and it is getting worse. The amenity of living in Australia (for those of us who knew it in the mid 90s) is now gone.

">The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, “it doesn’t matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn’t matter if it’s a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show”.

The irony of someone associated saying this without some degree of analytical backup is hilarious; folks looking for their first home would probably agree, those renting/looking for the next one would also agree (aka the demographic that has been ignored for the last few decades), those who just bought a home and getting hit with the reality of ""sometimes rates go up"" would agree, however those either fully paid off mortgage wise, or majority paid off I struggle to believe have the same sentiment as they would be pushing for their investment to drop in value.

Past that; again, immigration has only been a ""big issue"" the last 2-3 years or so, and to say house prices (especially relative to wages) were at all healthy pre-2020 is just gaslighting people.

Dropping immigration to 0 might help house prices a fraction, but the core system that sees the median house price grow faster than wages will still be in place, so we'd probably slam into a harder rescission and then people would have less borrowing power and have less purchasing power anyway.",0,the way people in her focus groups see it she says it does not matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down or unemployment is up or unemployment is down does not matter if it is a pandemic not a pandemic gfc or not a gfc housing is a horror show the irony of someone associated saying this without some degree of analytical backup is hilarious folks looking for their first home would probably agree those renting looking for the next one would also agree aka the demographic that has been ignored for the last few decades those who just bought a home and getting hit with the reality of sometimes rates go up would agree however those either fully paid off mortgage wise or majority paid off i struggle to believe have the same sentiment as they would be pushing for their investment to drop in value past that again immigration has only been a big issue the last years or so and to say house prices especially relative to wages were at all healthy pre is just gaslighting people dropping immigration to might help house prices a fraction but the core system that sees the median house price grow faster than wages will still be in place so we would probably slam into a harder rescission and then people would have less borrowing power and have less purchasing power anyway,way people focus group see say not matter whether interest rate interest rate unemployment unemployment not matter pandemic not pandemic gfc not gfc housing horror show irony someone associate say without degree analytical backup hilarious folk look first home would probably agree rent look next one would also agree aka demographic ignore last decade buy home get hit reality sometimes rate go would agree however either fully pay mortgage wise majority pay struggle believe sentiment would push investment drop value past immigration big issue last year say house price especially relative wage healthy pre gaslighting people drop immigration might help house price fraction core system see median house price grow faster wage still place would probably slam hard rescission people would less borrow power less purchase power anyway

"As much as I agree with Samaras, I think ultimately that Perrett saying that *""grand narratives belonged in election campaigns rather than budgets""* is probably the more practical truth.

This puts Labor in a position they're very comfortable in - lip service about the change they want, but only carrying out the changes they need (or believe they can afford) to make.

This is a fundamental issue with democracy under neoliberal and capitalist assumptions. It keeps the leftwing establishment from the proper work of nation building, keeps them ""tinkering around the edges"" as the article puts it - and allows for a ratcheting to the right of politics.

It's easy to cut taxes on wealth and big business donors. It's easy to take some money from here, put it there, to let Capitalism usurp your party's values over time. Much easier than standing up for your country, your values, or people who actually vote you in/out.

You need an economic radical to actually make substantial changes, someone willing to test things like Modern Monetary Theory, or to challenge mining giants.

"NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the “unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government.”

On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.

“It’s time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,” he said.

Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.

“It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally – Israel – to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,” Mr Leeser told The Australian. “But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?” “This is not an environmental party,” he said. “This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.”

‘What is Adam Bandt advocating for?’: Labor MP questions Greens leader’s announcement

Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.

Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not “just a symbolic move.”

“It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,” he said. “It is a concrete step towards peace.”

“As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.” Mr Bandt said the “scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.”

“A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.”

He warned that a “human engineered famine” was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that “amounts to collective punishment of these people.”

Mr Bandt said that Labor’s credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you “recognise just one side.”

“Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,” he said. “Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu.” Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting ‘un-Australian values’

Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.

“Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,” Mr Watts said..

“Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,” he said.

“Wedge politics only divides the community,” he said. “Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution … but the Greens aren’t serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.”

“On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,” he said. “Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.”

But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. “We see no role for them in this,” he said. “A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel’s security.”

“We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority … We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.”

Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. ‘End the occupation’: Greens Leader calls for Labor to 'take action' against Israel

“This motion … sends the message that Hamas’ violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,” he said. “This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.”

He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women’s rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the “cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.”

Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had “become a central plank of Green philosophy.”

“The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October – even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,” he said. “They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.”

Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC’s Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.

Reflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed “how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.”",0,nsw liberal mp julian leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the greens making the unilateral

"It sounds like you're chasing the life we're told we're supposed to want and appreciate every single day of our lives. It doesn't get better because most of us still miss the thing we need most- community, real community. Here's another perspective and a blunt one: I have it 'all', a 3mil house with no debt, I run a business that I only work 5 hrs on per week, I have a great husband and two beautiful sons. We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community. And it took me 10 years and money to realise that I'm deeply bored and unhappy. Nothing really excites me, except my kids milestones and smiles. How is that doing anything for the world? Just sitting here unhappy making money for the government in my secure safe little box. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I think most people hit this realisation ar a certain age and you only have a choice to keep at it or fuck it all off.

So we are selling our home and business this year, travelling to poorer countries, helping how we can, and experiencing life outside of the box. I feel SO MUCH better, SO relieved that there's 'more'. I'm actually elated, I rarely had that feeling anymore for years.

What I'm getting at is, it's unlikely a job and house and family will make you feel better. Assuming you're not depressed, just stuck in the cycle. Deep dive into who YOU are - not what you're told to be, and there's always an answer.

"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday’s budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.

Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.

Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.

Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. “The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,” Ms King told the Financial Review. “The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered.” Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those – 14 small projects worth about $444 million – were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory’s election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money – about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor’s signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money – about $136 million – went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to “bail out” Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. “It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,” Senator McKenzie said. “This government spreadsheet has only one colour, and

"Hey. Thanks for the reply. It's nice to know you can get out. Hopefully I can find something as well.

I'm not sure that there are many extra responsibilities I can take on. I've worked for my current company for over half my working life and I've worked in every department, including a stint as a supervisor that lasted for just over a year. 

I love to learn new things, and I think that's part of the reason I'm so desperate to get out, I feel like I've hit a brick wall of all that I can learn. That and the managers are kinda impossible to deal with currently. This is also combined with how shitty people are post COVID. Which is why I don't want to just get a similar job in another company. I want to get out of retail all together.

Working in the companies head office would be ideal as it's a part of the company I haven't worked in yet, but unfortunately it's located in Melbourne. 

I've got a mortgage that I share with someone and am responsible for helping take care of an elderly family member. So relocating is not possible with my current circumstances.

My brother says my issue is that I don't talk up the skills I have enough, and your reply kinda reinforced that that is something that is definitely needed.

">Put every possible solution on the table, don't legislate things away because you can't see past your ideology.


We haven't legislated away the ability to put nuclear in front of the Australian people, but no one wants to seem to do it. The biggest nuclear advocates in Australia are currently refusing to reveal their costings, or where they think these power plants would be built, or who would build them, or when it could be done.


The legislation doesn't prevent nuclear from being put on the table, the cluster fuck that is nuclear costings and build times is what is preventing nuclear from being put on the table. The actual reality of nuclear is why the advocates aren't putting the details on the table.

"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.

The saga of Miles Morgan Australia’s involvement in the “Future Fit” turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.

It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.

Miles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.

Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.

Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.

Miles Morgan Australia’s involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.

Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.

The government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had “a deep understanding” of the needs and a “strong working relationship with the Department”.

“This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department’s requirements,” the submission prepared for Colbeck says.

“This procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.”

Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an “open tender”.

That contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.

Within months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the “capability” for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.",0,a private consulting firm handed almost million in aged care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after

">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.

Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.

Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.

I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.

The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.

In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.

Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.

Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.

Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.

I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.

I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.

If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.

>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.

If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.

However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",0,the

"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to “shut down” airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being “disrespected” by government. “(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,” he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government’s latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had ­spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and “it’s very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action”.  
“Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop ­sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,” he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. “It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don’t want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.”  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to ­allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.

If the offer is rejected, Mr ­Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. “It’s difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,” he said. “What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. “We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other ­places like Holsworthy etc, we’re not actually putting the community at risk. “If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.”",0,the australian federal police union is threatening strike action to shut down airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the albanese government over pay and conditions afp association president alex caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether afp officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting saying members were sick of being disrespected by government we are considering walking out at airports walking out at parliament house walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the afp that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal he told the australian denouncing the government s latest pay offer of per cent mr caruana said he had spoken to about afpa members in recent days and it is very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action essentially it would be that airports might have to shut down parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements he said identifying the australian nuclear science and technology organisation and the holsworthy barracks as other potential locations for industrial action it is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the afp and they want a fair pay deal they do not want to be the lowest paid police force in australia the afpa is urging members to vote no to the afp pay offer which includes increases to allowances on top of per cent in wage rises over three years if the offer is rejected mr caruana said the union would examine applying to the fair work commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action it is difficult for the afp to do any strike action or withholding of labour action because of the implications to national security he said what i can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space we would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports and we were to withdraw labour from places like parliament house from places like antso and a few other places like holsworthy etc we are not actually putting the community at risk if the airports continue to operate the airports are then taking on that risk if parliament chooses to sit the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the afp act that would be in breach of national security and a step too far we will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the afp that they need to offer a fair wage deal for afp members,australian federal police union threaten strike action shut airport sit federal parliament severe escalation dispute albanese government pay condition afp association president alex caruana say union seek legal advice whether afp officer could legally walk airport parliament sit say member sick disrespected government consider walk airport walk parliament house walk commonwealth asset essentially shut order make point government afp serious fight pay condition want fair pay deal tell australian denouncing government late pay offer per cent mr caruana say spoken afpa member recent day clear willing vote yes action essentially would airports might shut parliament would stop sit certain asset might come arrangement say identify australian nuclear science technology organisation holsworthy barrack potential location industrial action severe escalation member sick disrespected government afp want fair pay deal not want low pay police force australia afpa urge member vote no afp pay offer include increase allowance top per cent wage rise three year offer reject mr caruana say union would examine apply fair work commission protect action ballot order authorise significant industrial action difficult afp strike action withhold labour action implication national security say say engage lawyer look option space would consider withdraw labour airport withdraw labour place like parliament house place like antso place like holsworthy etc not actually put community risk airport continue operate airport take risk parliament choose sit parliament take risk currently get legal advice whether not afp act would breach national security step far consider measure necessary get point across government afp need offer fair wage deal afp member

The NSW Coalition’s most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a “dereliction of duty” after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.

In an extraordinary move, Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government’s new laws, which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders, would pass without consultation.

The changes follow a string of high-profile alleged domestic violence offences, including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month.

The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens, the shadow attorney-general, argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws. He later said he had seen the government’s press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.

Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor’s laws.

However, Henskens’ push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.

Greenwich said he had been in parliament for “five premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments”, and he had never seen a proposal with “such disrespect to stakeholders in this space”.

“I’ve never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don’t want to consult with them,” Greenwich said.
“They want to rubber stamp something they haven’t ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.”

Leong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.

She said Henskens’ attempts to ram through the bill smacked of “relevance deprivation”.

Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.

“The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,” Hoenig said.
Attorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that “all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state”.
Domestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be “considered properly” before being passed.

On Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.
At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.

There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender’s release in the Supreme Court.

"A couple friends work in hospitality and I have to agree with the sentiment that casual workers seem easily exploited. 

But when did you get here? It wasn't always an employer's market. Pre-covid, at least in hospitality, casual workers could leave bad work environments because they had a lot more options. Post-covid there are fewer customers, rosters are thin, and venues closing down means workers are competing for fewer jobs, and they stick around even when mistreated.

A lot of casual work is taken up by visa holders like yourself, who don't have a safety net and tend to be even more exploitable, so I'm not sure it's Australian workers who are tolerant.

I think the real question is why are exploitative employers hard to hold accountable? There's Fair Work but they seem to only go after big corporations. In Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, there's JobWatch, but they've had funding massively cut last year.

Maybe you're asking why Australians don't care enough to fund organizations that support casual workers' rights.

">Yet even in light of this, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton complained last week that the number of public servants has swelled under the Albanese government, declaring the Coalition sees defence spending as “much more of a priority than office staff in Canberra”.

Gonna skip the usual Morrison circlejerk (oh Scott Morrison exercised political savvy to do no actual work? Shocker /s) and just highlight this point - the LNP will whinge Labor does nothing, but when Labor actually hires real staff to do work (more on ""real"" in a sec) now it is ""hiring for the wrong sectors/wasting money on 'too good' public servants"" and other bullshit.

I say ""real"", because the alternative is pure contractors, which often cost more than regular staff (since the worker and the company has to make a profit or else cut corners to make money) and yet are seen as ""good"" because hey you create private sector jobs (which are magically worth more than public sector jobs because ???).

"I’ll give you a quick breakdown of dating apps in Melbourne; 

-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots

-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.

-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 

- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 

-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 

I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 

My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don’t use it to date, it’s frowned upon but once you get out there you’ll meet people anyway. 

There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 

I am an introvert so it’s perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 

I am not single luckily, I wouldn’t want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. 

There are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it’s so toxic.

"I’m all for a human rights charter, however I am cynical that it would actually make any difference in many of these types of cases. Robodebt was already unjustifiable under our current legal system, or even under the most basic level of scrutiny. 

This is why the state is now up for huge sums in compensation for the wholly foreseeable harms it caused. 

The problem we face is that ministers are willing to breach the laws for short term electoral gains. Being able to claim a balanced budget when they know full well that it was going to swing back and hit us in the chin after the next election cycle, but they did it anyway because that was future Australia’s problem. 

Doubling down on extrajudicial sentencing after the high court has already ruled it out, shows that the bastardry is bipartisan. 

If robodebt and asylum seeker policy is anything to go by, the electorate is completely unwilling to hold these bastards accountable, because we collectively have the memory of a goldfish in low oxygen water.

"Im surprised. But honestly the ALP have done a bad job in terms of playing politics. 

The population for 2 years has been saying to do something about immigration/cost of living. They havent gotten on the front foot and shown they are doing something. 

A bit like ScoMos fire blunder. Cost of living was a major issue and he had The Voice. That died down and he stopped tradies from coming and ramped up immigration. They had a big argument over some minor changes to taxes that everyone wanted indexed anyway. He was given benefit of the doubt and now he has come out with a inflationary budget. People are saying when is he going to do something about cost of living.

Im not saying he doesnt care or he isnt doing anything. Im talking about the spin. He needs to recover the frame that he is the one to be voted in to handle cost of living. Thats always going to be a little tough for the ALP due to peoples perception as the LNP being better at managing the books. But him leaving it for so long hasnt given people confidence. He is running out of time. Because now anything that takes more than a year like essential infrastructure to improve housing supply is too late.

Now he is done with another budget. So he only has the one just before the election left which is too late. 

Dutton has come out with a major decrease to immigration which a lot of the public perceive as being a silver bullet to cost of living (I dont personally agree). That has really put Albo on the back foot.

As I said with no budget until just before the next election he doesnt have much of a chance to reset the publics perception. The media will keep piling on with the landlord/private jet/out of touch stuff and Dutton will keep quiet. QLD a major swing state also has a crime problem and an ex police Qlder will probably do well.

I still think Albo can win a majority but he needs something big to turn it around. Like a bushfire/refugee boats/covid that can be used politically to readjust perceptions.

">The NSW government is withholding more than half a billion dollars a year in waste levies collected from local councils, a NSW parliamentary committee has heard.

>The levy is also costing the state government money because it’s incentivising northern NSW councils to send their landfill across the border to Queensland, according to evidence presented to a NSW Standing Committee investigating the sustainability of local government.

>The United Services Union says instead of the levy being used to help councils manage waste more sustainably, it’s being hoarded in state government coffers.

>The union says the government collects around $750 million a year in waste levies from councils, but only invests $250 million of that back into waste management initiatives and pockets the rest.

>“The NSW Government is withholding money collected from local councils and their communities to the tune of $500 million a year through the waste levy,” General Secretary Graeme Kelly said ahead of his appearance before the committee on Friday.

>NSW losing out to Queensland

>The USU says the levy collected would be significantly more if funds collected by the state government were reinvested into new local and regional landfill sites, particularly in northern NSW where most councils are now sending landfill waste over the border to Queensland.

>“Waste being transported to Queensland is at a cost to ratepayers and results in no waste levy being collected in some regions,” Mr Kelly says.

>“The waste levy is supposed to be an environmental measure, but it’s become a perverse incentive for some councils to dodge the levy by dumping waste in Queensland.

>“Most of the councils on the north coast from Coffs Harbour to the Tweed Border use contractors who are technically robbing NSW councils and taxpayers by not paying the levy.”

>Broader financial crisis

>The USU argues the waste levy is just one symptom of the broader financial crisis facing local government in NSW and is also calling for an end to rate pegging, echoing [concerns raised by Local Government Professionals NSW](

>The USU wants to see the rate peg abolished as part of a broader reform package to secure the long-term financial sustainability of the local government sector.

>“Scrapping rate pegging won’t solve all the problems facing councils overnight, but it’s an essential first step,” Mr Kelly said.

"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.

“You actually can’t have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn’t begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,” says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.

The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, “it doesn’t matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn’t matter if it’s a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show”.

To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.

“They’re like, ‘We can’t get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people’,” says Huntley.

It’s not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.

Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.

Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being “swamped by Asians”. Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being “swamped by Muslims”.

In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were “out of control”.

“Was I right?” she asked her fellow senators. “You’d never admit it, but yes I was,” she said.

It’s hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.

It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is a good thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia’s immigration intake.

Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.

Lowe was president of the country’s pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10 years until 2014.

During that time, he tells *The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to “prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure”. The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be “taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment”.

“Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer … The boost to government budgets is enormous.”

So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today – as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.

Meanwhile, Australia’s population is on track to grow to about 40 million people – an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – by 2060.",0,rebecca

"He claimed that by “rebalancing the migration program … the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.”

How this number was calculated, he didn’t say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.

There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia’s borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.

According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia’s record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.

But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan’s deputy director of migration and labour markets, “asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it’s a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.”

Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, “it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.

“Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.”

With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton’s proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.

What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.

This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.

In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.

When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.

“In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost … numbers,” says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. “Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.

“The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,” says Rizvi.

The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government’s shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.

In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, “Scott Morrison told students to just go home,” says Honeywood.

“That caused incredible damage to Australia’s reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.",0,he claimed that by rebalancing the migration program the coalition would free up almost

"It's going to take about 6 months for McBride's new lawyers to put together an appeal. I can't prove his innocence in a reddit post. I just want to draw attention to the case, especially the blatant corruption of this judge and what that represents.

Politicians may not really care about their donors paying less taxes, but their bosses do. I hope judges are mostly honest as they have usually decided to make less money than they would as lawyers. However, this one has shown too many signs of corruption. The people who appoint and promote judges are corrupt and McBride had secrets they wouldn't let the public know.

Also, the judge hid that sentencing was going to take place until a last minute change of plans. I believe that being more senior, more visible and less incentivised to appease politicians should mean judges of the high court are trustworthy (certainly a hundred times more trustworthy than Mossop). I believe they will overturn the  verdict or at least give McBride a lighter sentence. Unfortunately legislators are highly against whistle blowing..

"Wrong. There is literally a ban on nuclear energy in Australia. The fact we have freedom of speech to discuss any policy idea is irrelevant and an attempt to obfuscate. 

How can anything be costed or tested, how can any investment even begin to be courted, while there is a ban? Why would a project proponent even start, or devote one iota of time and resources to it?

Your comments are just excuses, and the excuses keep shifting. Clearly, nuclear is successfully deployed all around the world, reducing carbon emissions. How come that reality isn't just slapping you in the face? How can you continue to claim it's untenable when reactors actually exist? 

Look what the Canadians did. It's fantastic. It's high tech. It's job-creating. It's good for energy security. And it fits with a centralised energy grid, complementing renewables through providing grid stability. 

Look what the IEA says:

""Nuclear power accounts for about 10% of electricity generation globally, rising to almost 20% in advanced economies. It has historically been one of the largest global contributors of carbon-free electricity and while it faces challenges in some countries, it has significant potential to contribute to power sector decarbonisation.""

"Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!

Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.

So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.

The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).

This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.

Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 

It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.

Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 

There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.

So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.",0,having been proven correct with respect

"I drink espresso so don’t really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 

I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is “Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance” and has “consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art” costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 

A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn’t it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn’t throwing away stock. 

Perhaps I’m over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don’t know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 

I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about a) I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b) I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that’s as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I’m definitely not a customer of yours and I don’t really care what the cost of a coffee is. I’m simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that’s hardly the case now.",0,i drink espresso so do not really have the issue with milk but curious as to why soy or almond milk incurs a higher charge for the most part soy milk is non perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities perhaps at a discount and stored because it has a longer shelf life i just did a quick scan and the alternative dairy co barista soy milk which claims it is uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance and has consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art costs for x litre cartons so per litre a litre of full cream dairy farmers milk costs around and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away does not it make sense to then encourage people to choose soy or almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and is not throwing away stock perhaps i am over simplifying it but it seems obvious that if an inner city cafe became known for selling soy almond or oat milk lattes for less than dairy milk lattes it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing i do not know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost i will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me i do not know what i am talking about a i do not know what i am talking about and b i have a machine at home i load in the beans that i like i push a button it grinds them and espresso comes out that is as complicated as my coffee existence gets so i am definitely not a customer of yours and i do not really care what the cost of a coffee is i am simply asking why soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes i get that many moons ago soy or almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that is hardly the case now,drink espresso not really issue milk curious soy almond milk incur high charge part soy milk non perishable stock could purchase high quantity perhaps discount store long shelf life quick scan alternative dairy co barista soy milk claim uniquely blend coffee freak lab coat geek unparalleled taste performance consistent texturing canvass perfect latte art cost x litre carton per litre litre full cream dairy farmer milk cost around could store short period may point need thrown away not make sense encourage people choose soy almond milk offer low price long run cafe save money not throw away stock perhaps simplify seem obvious inner city cafe become known selling soy almond oat milk lattes less dairy milk latte would attract customer want kind thing not know balance plant base versus dairy milk latte order would give day perhaps vast majority still seek dairy non dairy drinker still minority give theme thread sound like people would willing trek block even switch dairy plant base felt reasonable deal not far beyond cup coffee cost add couple caveat angry cafe owner tell not know talk not know talk b machine home load bean like push button grind espresso come complicate coffee existence get definitely not customer not really care cost coffee simply ask soy milk lattes incur additional fee make sense actually make cheap dairy base latte get many moon ago soy almond milk probably bit exclusive hardly case

"It’s a western global problem because most western nationals have took a very similar fiscal approach since the early 2000 but more importantly after the GFC.

Trillions was spent for the GFC and to stop a total collapse of the system. That money needed to be paid back, and the quickest and easiest way was to rapidly increase the tax base via immigration. 

Same with Covid, it’s literally by design. Problem is, it takes decades to build up the infrastructure, training, teachers and support etc to accommodate such levels of immigration.

Not to mention successful multiculturalism doesn’t really work if immigration happens at such levels so quick. Australia used to take the right approach in the early 2000s. But we are quickly heading into the same direction as Europe, and you only have to look at r/Europe to see how many such levels of immigration is having on there standards of living, on there culture aka it’s degrading rapidly.",0,it is a western global problem because most western nationals have took a very similar fiscal approach since the early but more importantly after the gfc trillions was spent for the gfc and to stop a total collapse of the system that money needed to be paid back and the quickest and easiest way was to rapidly increase the tax base via immigration same with covid it is literally by design problem is it takes decades to build up the infrastructure training teachers and support etc to accommodate such levels of immigration not to mention successful multiculturalism does not really work if immigration happens at such levels so quick australia used to take the right approach in the early s but we are quickly heading into the same direction as europe and you only have to look at r europe to see how many such levels of immigration is having on there standards of living on there culture aka it is degrading rapidly,western global problem western national take similar fiscal approach since early importantly gfc trillion spend gfc stop total collapse system money need pay back quick easy way rapidly increase tax base via immigration covid literally design problem take decade build infrastructure train teacher support etc accommodate level immigration not mention successful multiculturalism not really work immigration happens level quick australia use take right approach early quickly head direction europe look r europe see many level immigration standard live culture aka degrade rapidly

">I feel like I'm done with this industry

Yeah, every single person I know who has ever been a chef reached that point. It's just a shitty job - the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time. Working when you should be on a break.

A well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run. You could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find... You could create a good kitchen, but honestly if you're burned out and over it, then that's probably not the best option. A good manager is passionate about the job and you probably can't do that anymore. Maybe in a few years you might be able to.

If you can finish your Cert 4 easily, then absolutely do that. The piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job, maybe the one after that. It's worth having.

You could honestly do almost anything. A good mate of mine became a school teacher (they tried to get him to teach kids to cook... but he told them to fuck off. Literally dropped an F bomb in that meeting). He teaches maths and science. Doesn't have any particular aptitude for either subject, but he can read a high school textbook and that's all you really need (plus a relevant degree in teaching, obviously. He had to spend four years in university to get that - worked in a kitchen part time while studying)

Or, you could do what another mate did and move laterally - he's a hotel manager now. The hotel has a kitchen obviously, and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job, but doesn't actually work in the kitchen.

Ultimately, put your mental health first and get out of the situation you're in. You don't have to do it instantly - just start moving in that direction. You'll feel so much better once you've taken the first step, trust me. I'm in the middle of a similar transition myself (different industry though) — still working the job I don't like but I won't be much longer and that's made a huge difference.",0,i feel like i am done with this industry yeah every single person i know who has ever been a chef reached that point it is just a shitty job the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time working when you should be on a break a well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run you could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find you could create a good kitchen but honestly if you are burned out and over it then that is probably not the best option a good manager is passionate about the job and you probably cannot do that anymore maybe in a few years you might be able to if you can finish your cert easily then absolutely do that the piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job maybe the one after that it is worth having you could honestly do almost anything a good mate of mine became a school teacher they tried to get him to teach kids to cook but he told them to fuck off literally dropped an f bomb in that meeting he teaches maths and science does not have any particular aptitude for either subject but he can read a high school textbook and that is all you really need plus a relevant degree in teaching obviously he had to spend four years in university to get that worked in a kitchen part time while studying or you could do what another mate did and move laterally he is a hotel manager now the hotel has a kitchen obviously and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job but does not actually work in the kitchen ultimately put your mental health first and get out of the situation you are in you do not have to do it instantly just start moving in that direction you will feel so much better once you have taken the first step trust me i am in the middle of a similar transition myself different industry though still working the job i do not like but i will not be much longer and that is made a huge difference,feel like do industry yeah every single person know ever chef reach point shitty job main problem work specifically meal time work break well manage kitchen recognise set roster protect mental health staff kitchens not well run could try find good kitchen job hard find could create good kitchen honestly burn probably not best option good manager passionate job probably not anymore maybe year might able finish cert easily absolutely piece paper look good resume not next job maybe one worth could honestly almost anything good mate mine become school teacher try get teach kid cook told fuck literally drop f bomb meeting teach math science not particular aptitude either subject read high school textbook really need plus relevant degree teach obviously spend four year university get work kitchen part time study could another mate move laterally hotel manager hotel kitchen obviously ability manage kitchen help get job not actually work kitchen ultimately put mental health first get situation not instantly start move direction feel much good take first step trust middle similar transition different industry though still work job not like not much long make huge difference

Also highly rate Donnini's. The pasta here is great. They will look after you and no one I've ever been with has walked out unhappy. Just be aware it is expensive, pasta is $34-37.

"Just make the tobacco the same price as in Europe.    By putting such high tax in Australia on tobacco, they have created the illegal trade.   The high price means that smokers will buy illegal tobacco, and so hence it creates the market for illegal .

Criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that 5000% differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk.


 I like the New Zealand approach. The government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year. Eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers. The price of the tobacco is reasonable and so there is no market for the criminal gangs to make a profit with illegally important tobacco.

"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told *The Saturday Paper* that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it “very clear” that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue “would not be revisited before the election”.

“Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,” says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. “That and nothing else.”

Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.

Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.

In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children’s application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky’s ruling.

“Australian citizenship has to mean something,” says Tinkler. “Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?”

In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.

“AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,” Barton said.

In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.

In October 2022, Labor’s Home Affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.

Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, a terrorist organisation.

Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.

Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy’s return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.

“It wasn’t a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister’s office, and the pain of it hasn’t gone away.”

“They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they’re doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,” says Dabboussy.",0,prime minister anthony albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about australian women and children currently stranded in

"Interesting.

In an earlier article, this was what was apparently said:

*“Following on from Councillor Cruse’s comments, I totally agree government shouldn’t be worried about what people are getting up to in their bedrooms, I certainly don’t. But within the coalition of the LGBTQIA+ I just want to hone in on the plus. That includes a group of people who identify as minor attracted persons. I would encourage all citizens and councillors to look up what being a minor attracted persons means.” Dr Brough said.*

Dr Bough then doubled down on this position in a later interview.

This was a comment made apparently in reference to the Pride Festival held in Albany and some negative community feedback received in respect of it. Once again, I don't see this as an Agenda item in the February meeting.

Regardless, I have looked up what the plus means, because I don't really know. It is obvious Dr Bough's comments are inaccurate.

"It should need funding, ironically, the only people who receive funding or care are those that have developed extreme forms of illness such as psychosis, or those that have already broken the law and are now on some kind of order to be treated as a result through the courts.

If you go to a hospital beforehand seeking help you will be turned around and be told to use the privatised system.

Want to see an actual psychologist long term for a clinical condition indefinitely?  Once you hit your 10 sessions you pay entirely out of your own pocket.

It's a dimly lit road, it creates its own chaos and then ironically?

Even where the chain of causality is unbroken and the government is responsible for its own mess when a man stabs over 20 people, while there are laws to punish the doctors involved with medical negligence, at a criminal level, leading to a manslaughter charge... the knives are turned on the community as a whole instead. Ironically, the entirety of Queensland Health was aware who that person was hence the causality.

What I have learned is that the government is great at knee jerk reactions, and coming up with bad responses as a result.

But to be proactive, or even retroactive and to deal with the problem from where it stems from in the lack of interest in providing clinical care, or prosecuting those that allow for these lapses? That's a nigh on impossibility, even when the cases, and reasons for action are plonked directly in the face of governments that continue the harm...

I don't have all the answers but I have one, and it would start by holding the director of Queensland Health to account for the negligent homicide of 20 innocent people in Sydney last month and rooting out every bad practitioner that refuses to treat.

Maybe that's a tough road but at this point its what it deserves...

Those types of actions are beginning in the United States through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of Tony Timpa, but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding.

On that note, not having enough funding never means:

""Blame the patient...""

But clinicians attempt to assert that repeatedly nevertheless.

""Blame the patient for turning up with a mental health complaint (or outsource it to some third party that may or may not give a fuck).",0,it should need funding ironically the only people who receive funding or care are those that have developed extreme forms of illness such as psychosis or those that have already broken the law and are now on some kind of order to be treated as a result through the courts if you go to a hospital beforehand seeking help you will be turned around and be told to use the privatised system want to see an actual psychologist long term for a clinical condition indefinitely once you hit your sessions you pay entirely out of your own pocket it is a dimly lit road it creates its own chaos and then ironically even where the chain of causality is unbroken and the government is responsible for its own mess when a man stabs over people while there are laws to punish the doctors involved with medical negligence at a criminal level leading to a manslaughter charge the knives are turned on the community as a whole instead ironically the entirety of queensland health was aware who that person was hence the causality what i have learned is that the government is great at knee jerk reactions and coming up with bad responses as a result but to be proactive or even retroactive and to deal with the problem from where it stems from in the lack of interest in providing clinical care or prosecuting those that allow for these lapses that is a nigh on impossibility even when the cases and reasons for action are plonked directly in the face of governments that continue the harm i do not have all the answers but i have one and it would start by holding the director of queensland health to account for the negligent homicide of innocent people in sydney last month and rooting out every bad practitioner that refuses to treat maybe that is a tough road but at this point its what it deserves those types of actions are beginning in the united states through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of tony timpa but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding on that note not having enough funding never means blame the patient but clinicians attempt to assert that repeatedly nevertheless blame the patient for turning up with a mental health complaint or outsource it to some third party that may or may not give a fuck,need fund ironically people receive fund care develop extreme form illness psychosis already broken law kind order treat result court go hospital beforehand seek help turn around told use privatise system want see actual psychologist long term clinical condition indefinitely hit session pay entirely pocket dimly light road create chaos ironically even chain causality unbroken government responsible mess man stab people law punish doctor involve medical negligence criminal level lead manslaughter charge knife turn community whole instead ironically entirety queensland health aware person hence causality learned government great knee jerk reaction come bad response result proactive even retroactive deal problem stem lack interest provide clinical care prosecute allow lapse nigh impossibility even case reason action plonk directly face government continue harm not answer one would start hold director queensland health account negligent homicide innocent people sydney last month root every bad practitioner refuse treat maybe tough road point deserve type action begin united state civil action action wrongful death tony timpa widespread action need take healthcare practitioner need hold account clusterfuck situation create even claim duress not enough fund note not enough funding never mean blame patient clinician attempt assert repeatedly nevertheless blame patient turn mental health complaint outsource third party may may not give fuck

"Not really. The gist of Michael West's article is what's known as the doctrine of command responsibility.

[

It comes about when senior leaders did not *order* war crimes, but they *knew or should have known* and stopped them. This applies to military leaders, of course, which is what McBride was upset about. But it applies to political leaders, too - since ultimately, in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership. 

Just think of it this way. Let's imagine that our intervention in Afghanistan had been a stunning success. Let's say that today - because of Australia's intervention - the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy. Do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit?

Of course. So - if you're to take the credit when things go well under your leadership, you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly. 

That's the doctrine of command responsibility. As the wikpedia article quotes,

>*The Prosecutor v.* [*Delalić*]( *et al.* (""the Čelebići case"") first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that ""had reason to know"" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have ""had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of ... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether ... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.""

Returning to the article, a link within it,

[

notes that then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith was in 2012 made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days. There is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims - in fact he publicly denied them. 

The Minister for Defence is in overall control of the ADF. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, Stephen Smith may be responsible for war crimes. 

Anthony Albanese was a member of Cabinet at this time. Given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time, Albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them. However, over the period of ALP government 2007-13 he held a variety of roles (including Deputy PM under Rudd), and so it would be arguable when, where or whether he could be held responsible. Nonetheless he was a member of a government where the ADF was suspected to be committing war crimes, and the government rejected action on this.",0,not really the gist of michael west s article is what is known as the doctrine of command responsibility it comes about when senior leaders did not order war crimes but they knew or should have known and stopped them this applies to military leaders of course which is what mcbride was upset about but it applies to political leaders too since ultimately in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership just think of it this way let us imagine that our intervention in afghanistan had been a stunning success let us say that today because of australia s intervention the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit of course so if you are to take the credit when things go well under your leadership you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly that is the doctrine of command responsibility as the wikpedia article quotes the prosecutor v delali et al the elebi i case first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that had reason to know article means that a commander must have had in his possession information of a nature which at the least would put him on notice of the risk of offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates returning to the article a link within it notes that then defence minister stephen smith was in made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days there is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims in fact he publicly denied them the minister for defence is in overall control of the adf under the doctrine of command responsibility stephen smith may be responsible for war crimes anthony albanese was a member of cabinet at this time given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them however over the period of alp government he held a variety of roles including deputy pm under rudd and so it would be arguable when where or whether he could be held responsible nonetheless he was a member of a government where the adf was suspected to be committing war crimes and the government rejected action on this,not really gist michael west article know doctrine command responsibility come senior leader not order war crime know know stopped applies military leader course mcbride upset applies political leader since ultimately democracy military act direction civilian political leadership think way let u imagine intervention afghanistan stun success let u say today australia intervention country peaceful stable liberal democracy think member government day would want take credit course take credit thing go well leadership willing take blame go badly doctrine command responsibility wikpedia article quote prosecutor v delali et al elebi case first consider scope command responsibility conclude reason know article mean commander must possession information nature least would put notice risk offence indicate need additional investigation order ascertain whether crime commit committed subordinate return article link within note defence minister stephen smith make aware allegation war crime publicly within day no indication take measure whatsoever investigate claim fact publicly deny minister defence overall control adf doctrine command responsibility stephen smith may responsible war crime anthony albanese member cabinet time give war crime allegation air medium time albanese not claim unaware however period alp government hold variety role include deputy pm rudd would arguable whether could hold responsible nonetheless member government adf suspect commit war crime government reject action

-Not overly or under sensitive 
-Less chance for it to get caught on anything if I go commando
-Phismosis is not a concern for me

Cons:

-Being middle ground on sensitivity means you can still feel negative things

-More likely that if I get sweat pimples, they can form around and even at the tip at times.

"**PAYWALL:**

Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia’s housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government’s list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.

As part of the government’s December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the “core skills occupations list”.

Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as “targeted for consultation”, rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.

A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was “bizarre” given the industry’s “mammoth task” of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.

In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages “would be a failure”.

“Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,” Wawn said on Tuesday.

“Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the ‘maybe’ list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.”

A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O’Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final “core skills occupations list”.

“Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,” the spokesperson said.

Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.

Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.

“\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,” she said.

“There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.”

Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council’s State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government’s target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.

In December, O’Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but “we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships”.

However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.",0,paywall plumbers bricklayers cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle australia s housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government s

"Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste. It's sourced from a small number of places, with a small number of providers. The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.

Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.

The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.

Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.",0,gas runs out it produces ongoing waste it is sourced from a small number of places with a small number of providers the price can rise incredibly sharply when policies national state or corporate change supply can be cut off renewables do not run out that is their whole point they do not in general produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use or at least it is significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear the production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances and because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies and even in house by businesses and individuals it is a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt hour even on initial equipment costs it is not controlled by a small number of providers it does not need large scale and separate infrastructure of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid to be maintained it does not need things continually physically transported in order to operate and it is a lot harder to cut off supply when more end consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally the only two reasons to go with non renewables are price per watt hour and politics from people who want to make all the money and or have control over fuel supplies and the first reason is rapidly approaching a non issue especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste management costs from every aspect of the operational process previously the first reason held economic sway and it made sense to go with non renewables i am not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time but it is becoming far less of one and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has over time,gas run produce ongoing waste source small number place small number provider price rise incredibly sharply policy national state corporate change supply cut renewables not run whole point not general produce ongoing waste multiple type point production point use least significantly less fossil fuel nuclear production equipment either highly recyclable likely able become technology advance renewable power produce thousand company even house business individual lot hard price anything go per watt hour even initial equipment cost not control small number provider not need large scale separate infrastructure kind significantly different exist electrical grid maintain not need thing continually physically transport order operate lot hard cut supply end consumer produce least needs source rest extremely locally two reason go non renewables price per watt hour politics people want make money control fuel supply first reason rapidly approach non issue especially factor total cleanup waste management cost every aspect operational process previously first reason hold economic sway make sense go non renewables not point finger people make decision time become far less one increasingly likely swing renewables large scale already time

"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.

In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.

[

So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.

This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.

At the moment, the ""green hydrogen"" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue. If it's genuinely useful it doesn't need subsidies.

 The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector. It is not. It is a powerful, cashed-up lobby group promoting the interests of wind, water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in Australia.

Last month, the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards, airport lounges and lifts in prime Sydney and Melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking Australia’s future. It is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the Coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election.

Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Ted O’Brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix. Intermittent, disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid. Gas also would be a crucial part of the mix, principally because of its agility to ramp up or down, compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources.

Yet the renewables sector has bought none of it. It regards the election of a Coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight. Implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out. It would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory.

“It is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt – not just temporarily, but for good,” wrote Giles Parkinson, the editor of Renew Economy, the sector’s equivalent of the China Daily.

Giles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions, network capacity, connection delays, social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition.

At the end of the week, the announcement that the NSW government would pay Origin up to $225m to keep the Eraring Power Station operating for two years beyond its planned 2025 retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal. The Victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with EnergyAustralia, the owner of Yallourn, and AGL, which operates Loy Yong A. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system. The theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited.

The Australian Energy Market Operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next 10 years, named somewhat optimistically as the Statement of Opportunities. AEMO said it had been advised of “numerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects”, meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between 2025 and 2028.

This would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events, or blackouts as most people would call them. It gets worse. The new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate Bowen anticipated 18 months ago, and they need to get connected to the grid. Building 10,000km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected. Planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget.

There is no good news for Bowen or the sector in the AEMO report. Project EnergyConnect, the interconnection between NSW and South Australia, was regarded as the most straightforward high-voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory. Yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until July 2027 at the earliest. That will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the Torrens Island B and Osborne power stations shut. In NSW, delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected, and Victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission.

Even if we accept AEMO’s optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline, this is hardly the fast-track transition the government promised. In October 2022, Bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government’s 82 per cent clean electricity target by 2030 would require the installation of 22,000 solar panels a day, 62 million in total, by the end of the decade. It would require a 7-megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every 18 hours, each as high as Crown’s One Barangaroo tower in Sydney. About 10,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines would be needed to link up the vastly expanded network.",0,paywall the clean energy council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy

"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.

Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry’s services.

Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a “limited-term contract” in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads’ licensing and registration arms – a deal due to expire in the 2060s.

The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was “hoping to close any deal by the end of the year”.

A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria’s bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.

A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.

“It can probably be done better,” the minister said.

The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.

Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.

Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.

“Victoria’s Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.”

The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.

Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.

The same budget papers forecast Victoria’s debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.

Labor’s primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.

But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government’s management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.

Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.

Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.

“Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,” Joyce said. “He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.”

Joyce said while Victoria’s debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often “short-term gain for long-term pain”.

“For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security – cybersecurity in particular – could quite quickly run into trouble.

“It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.”

Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.

The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services’ most recent publicly available annual report.

The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.

It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.

The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.

Driver licensing and registration aren’t the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.

The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.

Last year’s housing statement also revealed Melbourne’s public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.

When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.

“This is not privatisation in anybody’s language,” the treasurer said at the time.

“We’re always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.”

The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria’s coffers.

Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.

However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency’s licensing and registration for the next 40 years.",0,the debt

">I grew up thinking you needed a sink or bucket full of soapy water, then you wash from glassware to plates and finishing with the most dirty pan.

Because of how precious water is here in Australia and I grew up in drought for many years, we are basically taught not to waste water.  America on the other hand have no concept of wastage. And that can carry over to many household jobs, such as washing bath towels.  When you go to a hotel in America, they change your towels every day, a lot of places here change them once or twice a week and at the end of your stay.

"Trans are always unreliable and the PtV app is *waaaaayyy* too optimistic. Thinking that you can get through on a 4 minute connection or something. As if they aren’t continually running off scheduled times.

They get held up by traffic, the passenger load is unpredictable. The passengers are unreliable. Sometimes there’s a million people every stop takes 3 minutes to load/unload. Sometimes there are none and they fly through the stops. 

Sometimes there are people trying to bring a shopping trolley onto the tram and then the tram driver needs to have an argument. And then the passenger eventually agrees to unload their trolley and shouts at everyone to help them. And then the passenger starts huffing and hurling abuse. And then the tram driver has to stop again to ask them to stop. And then the driver has to call the cops. And then the driver maybe feels a little bad for calling the cops maybe and warns the passenger to get off at next stop because the cops will be waiting at the one after that.

"I mean it was simple decades ago. Use the raw materials to make shit. High tech shit. Instead of exporting it for nothing.

Renewable industry? Green steel. Steel is massively energy intensive to produce. Build absolutely massive solar farms, use the raw materials here to build Green steel, export it.

Heck, if the government hasn't fucked everyone decades ago by selling off energy generation to the private industry, we could tempt manufacturing here by offering hugely discounted power pricing.

Never happened because of party politics. Decades of liberal scare campaign, ads showing the poor miners losing their jobs.

Basically, the tech exists to make the switch, thermal storage works great for overnight power. But the rich and powerful have easy access to politicians, so much so that the opposition leader took a flight across the country to spend 3 hours at a party with the human parasite known as Gina.
So we never got any traction in making these changes.

I was saying 15 years ago that if we don't start moving away from coal at a reasonable rate now, we will be forced to do it later at a much more painful rate. I was not alone in this. Instead, voters decided to keep voting in the guys who were beholden to those making money off coal. So, here we are. Reap what you sew I guess?

"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. 

I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.

I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.

Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 

As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes [be]( [unneccesarily]( [specific]( however using the geographical centre of the seat (as the NSWEC does) leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.

If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?

Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.",0,bit off topic but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for nsw the eastern half of metro sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats and i am curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place i do not think it is feasible for a cross harbour seat to be created so i think north sydney especially as it is one of the federation seats and sydney are not going anywhere i think if one of the northern seats will disappear the one which makes most geographical sense will be warringah mackellar cannot move north of the hawkesbury as it will be non contiguous so i think it will become a thinner beach oriented seat bradfield bennelong and north sydney could be pushed east the latter could feasibly cross middle harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of manly then again the aec wants to retain aboriginal place names when possible which complicates things yet again as a side note i dislike the practice of non geographical names for electoral divisions even though in this case warringah is a geographical name i am no advocate for the american numerical system and i do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be unneccesarily specific however using the geographical centre of the seat as the nswec does leads to fewer absurdities lake george for instance existed within the seat of werriwa for only a decade and warringah possibly moving north to replace mackellar while no longer covering middle harbour just creates another pointless quirk if it is on the south side of the harbour then i think it will be messier wentworth is another seat so i could see its boundaries moving south alternatively sydney could theoretically be split between wentworth and grayndler it is oddly enough the newest of the three but i do not think that would please anyone i cannot imagine the aec removing albanese s seat either possibly barton could be partitioned also interested to see what will happen in the hunter labor seems intent on shoring up hunter at the expense of paterson demographics trending away from the party in both by drawing in maitland and cutting out the upper hunter but the geographical constraints of port stephens and lake macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an illinois mapmaker blush,bit topic really interest see propose boundary nsw eastern half metro sydney set lose one maybe two seat curious side harbour take place not think feasible cross harbour seat create think north sydney especially one federation seat sydney not go anywhere think one northern seat disappear one make geographical sense warringah mackellar not move north hawkesbury non contiguous think become thinner beach orient seat bradfield bennelong north sydney could push east latter could feasibly cross middle harbour similar manner state seat manly aec want retain aboriginal place name possible complicates thing yet side note dislike practice non geographical name electoral division even though case warringah geographical name no advocate american numerical system recognise geographical name sometimes unneccesarily specific however use geographical centre seat nswec lead few absurdity lake george instance exist within seat werriwa decade warringah possibly move north replace mackellar no longer cover middle harbour create another pointless quirk south side harbour think messier wentworth another seat could see boundary move south alternatively sydney could theoretically split wentworth grayndler oddly enough new three not think would please anyone not imagine aec remove albanese seat either possibly barton could partition also interested see happen hunter labor seem intent shore hunter expense paterson demographic trend away party draw maitland cut upper hunter geographical constraint port stephen lake macquarie could well lead arragement would make illinois mapmaker blush

"Typical nonsense from Greg Jericho. No one was claiming that a wage price spiral caused our current inflation crisis, the actions of the RBA and commentary about it was in order to prevent a wage price from occurring.

Now it seems like the RBA was largely successful in avoiding that outcome (although wages are contributing to the stickiness of services inflation), Jericho claims this as vindication.

It’s like the morons who claimed GFC stimulus payments were a waste of money because we didn’t have a recession in Australia.

"There’s still lots of money out there being spent and it’s pushing up inflation. I work in sales, we distribute composite decking, cladding and screening through trade hardware stores. 

Generally speaking cladding goes on new builds while decking is mostly for the renovations/add on market. Usually the colder months are slow, with cladding holding sales together, while summers the decking really takes off (people are short sighted, they only want to put in decks when it gets warm and realise they don’t have one, or their existing one is falling apart). 

We had a bit of a slow start this year, but this month we are getting ‘summer’ level of sales, both in decking and cladding, which is something that none of us really expected. Cladding would make sense because builds happen year round, but people are spending big on renovations as well, which isn’t what you’d expect during a cost of living crisis. 

As much as I’d love to say this is because I’m an amazing sales rep, every other state is pushing similar numbers, with sales at 120% of budget coming into the end of financial year. I’ve got friends that work for our competitors and they are also seeing the same results. There may be a cost of living crisis somewhere, but it sure as shit isn’t everywhere, and we expect even more money pumped into the economy come early August as that’s bonus/commission season for anyone in sales and corporate, as well as tax return season.",1,there is still lots of money out there being spent and it is pushing up inflation i work in sales we distribute composite decking cladding and screening through trade hardware stores generally speaking cladding goes on new builds while decking is mostly for the renovations add on market usually the colder months are slow with cladding holding sales together while summers the decking really takes off people are short sighted they only want to put in decks when it gets warm and realise they do not have one or their existing one is falling apart we had a bit of a slow start this year but this month we are getting summer level of sales both in decking and cladding which is something that none of us really expected cladding would make sense because builds happen year round but people are spending big on renovations as well which is not what you would expect during a cost of living crisis as much as i would love to say this is because i am an amazing sales rep every other state is pushing similar numbers with sales at of budget coming into the end of financial year i have got friends that work for our competitors and they are also seeing the same results there may be a cost of living crisis somewhere but it sure as shit is not everywhere and we expect even more money pumped into the economy come early august as that is bonus commission season for anyone in sales and corporate as well as tax return season,still lots money spend push inflation work sale distribute composite deck cladding screen trade hardware store generally speak cladding go new build deck mostly renovation add market usually colder month slow cladding hold sale together summer deck really take people short sight want put deck get warm realise not one exist one fall apart bit slow start year month get summer level sale deck cladding something none u really expect cladding would make sense build happen year round people spend big renovation well not would expect cost live crisis much would love say amazing sale rep every state push similar number sale budget come end financial year get friend work competitor also see result may cost living crisis somewhere sure shit not everywhere expect even money pump economy come early august bonus commission season anyone sale corporate well tax return season

"I just went through this with my tenant who wants to break the lease on 10 days notice.

Anyway he’s leaving a few months before his 12 month contract.

I had to option to charge him the leasing and advertising fee. I choose not to charge this but I will hold him to paying the rent until I find someone else.

I won’t be picky about the new tenant as long as they have a job and reasonable rental history just like I would for any tenant. Single mothers no problems.

Even in a rental crisis It does take time to find a tenant. Just most people who want to rent a place will want to move in after 2 to 4 weeks (gives them time to exit their current living arrangement).

I’ve always found the winter months are harder to find a tenant as most people start their lease at the end of or start of the year.

I have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced. Ie building volumes are reducing under labor. At the same time as massive population growth.

The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 

Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 

So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 

Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked. Ie 3 years should be long enough to have some influence on building volumes rather than a negative result...

Hey dude. You can find the GenCost report here: 

At the topic of page 32, the first sentence on the page, it says this:

> **Our approach is to include a large‐scale nuclear cost that represents the cost associated with a continuous building program.** Costs from new or sporadic national building programs are at risk of incurring FOAK premiums. While we recognise the likely occurrence of a FOAK premium, where possible, GenCost does not include them for other technologies not yet deployed in Australia and so does not intend to do so for large‐scale nuclear. South Korea was identified as the best representation of a continuous building program.

The cost is literally based on South Korea which has been building reactors since 1970. That figure is WAY undercooked and its still fucking ridiculous.

"The issues with rugby in Australia go far deeper than juat the rebels being shut down. A lot of it stems from the fact that rugby is very NSW centric. The minute anyone proposes any decent change, the Shute shield clubs throw a fit. 

It also doesn't help that basic tickets to a test match are $100 minimum for decent seats. Myself and a mate of mine went to the England midyear test here in Sydney a few years back, and the tickets were 160ish a person. 

It's also the fact that rugby is not on free to air. There is almost no advertising for it. If you were to be asked who the wallabies are playing coming up, would you be able to answer. 

There is also almost no support for grassroots rugby. The number of smaller clubs that either fold or are forced to amalgamate just to be able to play is also a sad indication of where rugby is at.",0,the issues with rugby in australia go far deeper than juat the rebels being shut down a lot of it stems from the fact that rugby is very nsw centric the minute anyone proposes any decent change the shute shield clubs throw a fit it also does not help that basic tickets to a test match are minimum for decent seats myself and a mate of mine went to the england midyear test here in sydney a few years back and the tickets were ish a person it is also the fact that rugby is not on free to air there is almost no advertising for it if you were to be asked who the wallabies are playing coming up would you be able to answer there is also almost no support for grassroots rugby the number of smaller clubs that either fold or are forced to amalgamate just to be able to play is also a sad indication of where rugby is at,issue rugby australia go far deep juat rebel shut lot stem fact rugby nsw centric minute anyone propose decent change shute shield club throw fit also not help basic ticket test match minimum decent seat mate mine go england midyear test sydney year back ticket ish person also fact rugby not free air almost no advertising ask wallaby play come would able answer also almost no support grassroots rugby number small club either fold forced amalgamate able play also sad indication rugby

">how seriously would you take the threat

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.

My advice is that — don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.

It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not — your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.

Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.

The analogy I'd use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box. What's in the box? It could be an empty box or full of lead weights. How could I ever know? You need to tell me. I sure as heck don't want the person carrying the box to hurt themselves and need back surgery. But I'm also not likely to interrupt their work and check how heavy the box is, unless they're a new employee still being trained.",0,how seriously would you take the threat that is a tough one it is incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is mentally and i am not a psychiatrist so there is no fucking way i am going to trust my own judgement my advice is that do not rely on your own judgement because this is too important to get wrong it is also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to having said that as someone who is a manager i would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much i do not really know how hard someone is working unless i am closely supervising them and frankly i do not have time to do that i have got too many people under me i rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload the analogy i would use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box what is in the box it could be an empty box or full of lead weights how could i ever know you need to tell me i sure as heck do not want the person carrying the box to hurt themselves and need back surgery but i am also not likely to interrupt their work and check how heavy the box is unless they are a new employee still being trained,seriously would take threat tough one incredibly difficult judge strong someone mentally not psychiatrist no fucking way go trust judgement advice not rely judgement important get wrong also hard know word superior not colleague would do want say someone manager would absolutely want know one employee work much not really know hard someone work unless closely supervise frankly not time get many people rely people tell need give light workload analogy would use look someone carry cardboard box box could empty box full lead weight could ever know need tell sure heck not want person carry box hurt need back surgery also not likely interrupt work check heavy box unless new employee still train

It's not much of a stretch to say that for a ""short term one-off"" project you don't want to add public servant FTEs that then need to be served a redundancy when the project completes.

  
It's a lot harder to justify when you have:

\* project teams that move directly to the next project in the queue when their current one winds up

\* long term rollover contracts for ongoing service provision

"Because it was a literal conspiracy theory:

>“Under that NATIVE TITLE, NO ONE will have any ownership rights whatsoever under NATIVE TITLE,” then adding that  “THE WEF/NEW WORLD ORDER WILL BECOME OUR GLOBAL LANDLORD.” 

Meanwhile the [factcheck]( stated:

>Dr Galloway said any grant of freehold title (private property) in Australia permanently extinguishes native title.  “Once ‘private land’ exists, there is no native title,” she said. “So the proposition simply cannot be true.""

"I dropped out of my science degree, so I'm personally a bad example LOL. But because I was part of a Science cohort, and now work at the uni I dropped out of, I happen to have a lot of Science uni friends. 

I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 

Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.

My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 

My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 

A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD).",1,i dropped out of my science degree so i am personally a bad example lol but because i was part of a science cohort and now work at the uni i dropped out of i happen to have a lot of science uni friends i will say no one is making the big bucks do not know anyone doing astrophysics though only know of a handful of phd students in that field all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their phd some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads my best friend did a double degree in chemistry and commerce has always been smart and hardworking now works for sydney water with a salary of k my partner is a forensic science major with skills leaning towards chemistry i told him on our first year of dating when we were years old that he was not going to find a job in that field it is an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred he is had science roles since then one at the university and now at a pathology lab pay is pretty bad though just under k for working night shifts but the job is not that stressful and he is not career ambitious a handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about k but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment some are ok with this because they are doing their research masters and thinking about phd,drop science degree personally bad example lol part science cohort work uni drop happen lot science uni friend say no one make big buck not know anyone astrophysics though know handful phd student field relatively prestigious university undergraduate participate institutional research project prior phd anecdotal story friends science grad best friend double degree chemistry commerce always smart hardworking work sydney water salary k partner forensic science major skill lean towards chemistry tell first year date year old not go find job field impossible field science get unless want get mess join police get transfer science role since one university pathology lab pay pretty bad though k work night shift job not stressful not career ambitious handful friend work lab research assistant full time equivelent salary k not able get full time ongoing employment ok research master think phd

"I mean, just yesterday I drove a $120,000 medium rigid truck - 20 tons, 10 wheels, WITH L PLATES ON!!!

I didn't own the truck obviously. I'm just a guy working towards my truck license. I'm also not a youngster - just decided I'd like to have a truck license since occasionally I've wished I had one.

Honestly, I'd expect someone young to be the most likely to actually have a use for a big truck. They almost certainly don't have enough disposable income have a vehicle like that just because it looks cool. Some people do put cargo in the back of their truck regularly. And those big RAMS can carry a lot more weight than a 2WD Hilux.

I've driven a 2WD hilux fully loaded with a trailer... it was not fun. I had the accelerator pedal on the floor for about an hour and even down hill it only reached 90km/h - the wind resistance alone was more than the tiny motor could handle, let alone the weight — which would've been about half a ton in the tray and another ton on the trailer. It was safe, the suspension and brakes could totally handle the weight. But the motor? Fuck me that thing wasn't good enough. Also that one hour drive used half a tank of petrol — motors are only efficient when they're not working too hard.

I’m already paying out the arse for the meals and drinks, and I’m not overly fond of  adding to what is probably already a decent pot for the evening. 

I more likely to approach the pass and thank the chefs, slide a $50 for a round of after work drinks to one of them, while ensuring a couple of the others know as well. Chefs can be dodgy as fuck!


Again… I rarely go out these days. Above refers to 2000- 2016, before I relocated to the Top End.

"AAT senior member Chris Furnell said the man’s case was finely balanced between protecting the Australian community against other considerations including his ties to Australia. Mr Furnell ultimately opted to cancel the revocation of the man’s visa.
The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese ­government’s handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.

Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
“Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won’t change this direction and why he won’t change it immediately,” Mr Tehan said.
“What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister’s own making.”

Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT’s decision to reinstate Saki’s visa as “inconsistent” with Direction 99.

Asked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a “significant ­emphasis on serious offending and family violence – which need to be considered in all matters”.",0,aat senior member chris furnell said the man s case was finely balanced between protecting the australian community against other considerations including his ties to australia mr furnell ultimately opted to cancel the revocation of the man s visa the fallout from direction comes amid ongoing scrutiny of mr giles and the albanese government s handling of the people released from indefinite detention following a high court decision late last year several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences opposition immigration spokesman dan tehan said it was clear that direction was having an impact on community safety andrew giles needs to explain why he will not change this direction and why he will not change it immediately mr tehan said what this clearly shows is that your ties to australia are given primacy over everything else no matter how andrew giles tries to spin it he is endangering the australian community through the changes he made once again this is a complete mess of the minister s own making mr giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to saki and criticised the aat s decision to reinstate saki s visa as inconsistent with direction asked on friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on direction a spokesman for mr giles said the direction placed a significant emphasis on serious offending and family violence which need to be considered in all matters,aat senior member chris furnell say man case finely balance protect australian community consideration include tie australia mr furnell ultimately opted cancel revocation man visa fallout direction come amid ongoing scrutiny mr giles albanese government handle people release indefinite detention follow high court decision late last year several individual since arrest fresh offence opposition immigration spokesman dan tehan say clear direction impact community safety andrew giles need explain not change direction not change immediately mr tehan say clearly shows tie australia give primacy everything else no matter andrew giles try spin endanger australian community change make complete mess minister make mr giles say week seek urgent advice relation saki criticise aat decision reinstate saki visa inconsistent direction ask friday number visa reinstatement rely direction spokesman mr giles say direction place significant emphasis serious offend family violence need consider matter

"I have done a lot of research on finding the best cookie and they aren't quite in the city. And it does depend on what sort of cookie you like, I don't really like the levain giant soft cookies so these are my recommendations which are more crispy 
 
The best cookie can be found at the bread club they have two locations and we go to the albert park one. Their toffee chocolate cookie is to die for

Then these guys are a hidden secret. They specialise in bite size crispy cookie. If I let myself I'd eat a whole packet on my own

"I am surprised to see this from Ed Husic. It isn't the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late, but it's good to see this get raised by the ALP as it'll probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it. 

Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 

But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 

Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity. 

Shame.",0,i am surprised to see this from ed husic it is not the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late but it is good to see this get raised by the alp as it will probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it our company income tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions with the average in our region being and if we are truly concerned with productivity this is where we start but whilst the highest marginal tax rate is a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage particularly in personal services income fields had we proceeded with s tc as we should have lowering the top rates and pushing out to x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity shame,surprised see ed husic not transformational tax change many call late good see get raise alp probably first properly bipartisan policy serious company income tax rate high average rate region average region truly concerned productivity start whilst high marginal tax rate reduction corporate rate encourages tax rate arbitrage particularly personal service income field proceed tc lower top rate push x average would remove incentive totally would allow u low company tax rate attract investment unlock productivity shame

"This Mexican restaurant in Penrith is a great find. We decided to try their set menu, which was delicious and more than enough to satisfy our group. I highly recommend their ceviche, fried chicken, and watermelon salad. Best enjoyed with their classic margarita. The only hiccup during our visit was the wait time; we waited for over 40 minutes for our reservation. The hostess was apologetic, and we understood that our group was quite large, with other big parties in the restaurant. However, some improved reservation management could enhance the overall dining experience.",1,this mexican restaurant in penrith is a great find we decided to try their set menu which was delicious and more than enough to satisfy our group i highly recommend their ceviche fried chicken and watermelon salad best enjoyed with their classic margarita the only hiccup during our visit was the wait time we waited for over minutes for our reservation the hostess was apologetic and we understood that our group was quite large with other big parties in the restaurant however some improved reservation management could enhance the overall dining experience,mexican restaurant penrith great find decide try set menu delicious enough satisfy group highly recommend ceviche fry chicken watermelon salad best enjoyed classic margarita hiccup visit wait time wait minute reservation hostess apologetic understood group quite large big party restaurant however improve reservation management could enhance overall dining experience

"I found this restaurant by the recommendation of a Nepali friend. So I gave it a try. We ordered, Samosas and a fried chicken sausage for appetisers, and they were pretty good And for mains, the fried rice was unlike any I had tasted before, and the Bamboo Jhol Momo offered a new culinary experience in Adelaide. While the Pomegranate Mojito was refreshing, the Khukuri Katta cocktail was a disappointment as it served warm and tasted overly syrupy that was overpowering, which I did n't enjoy at all Everything was good except for the live music going on, which was overly loud for a small venue, and it kills the entire vibe of having a decent meal at a restaurant. We had to talk loud among ourselves to have a conversation! The portion sizes are average, and the prices are reasonable for a CBD restaurant.

"The coffee is exceptional here. Like next level. Beautiful flavour, expertly made, and very nicely presented. It an all round winner that emphatically underscores the view that you can get great coffee in regional areas. Nice egg and bacon roll here. A generous size with a good amount of egg and bacon. The tomato relish was a little too sweet for me though and it was so liberally applied that it oozed out the side of the roll with the slightest pressure. The chicken and pesto roll thingy was a tiny bit disappointing for me-I found it a bit bland and over complicated-but not so for my partner who enjoyed it. It not cheap here but it all good quality. The cafe is small and it nicely and fashionably set out in the urban hipster style with some good tables on the street. It was doing a very brisk takeaway trade while we were here and plenty of people were on the outside tables too. The staff were young and friendly and doing a good job in an amiable way.

"A fascinating intriguing tactile "" sculpture "". To some it does stand out like a sore thumb from its surroundings. But in and of itself, it's evocative. It contains elements I would associate with the fairy folk in fantasy lore. It is located right along the main highway so it is hard to miss. The ground around it is sloped, do take care. There are these circular holes on one side that looks towards the bridge that makes for interesting photos.",1,a fascinating intriguing tactile sculpture to some it does stand out like a sore thumb from its surroundings but in and of itself it is evocative it contains elements i would associate with the fairy folk in fantasy lore it is located right along the main highway so it is hard to miss the ground around it is sloped do take care there are these circular holes on one side that looks towards the bridge that makes for interesting photos,fascinate intrigue tactile sculpture stand like sore thumb surroundings evocative contains element would associate fairy folk fantasy lore locate right along main highway hard miss ground around slop take care circular hole one side look towards bridge make interesting photo

"Came here in the sweet spot around 3 at the end of their lunch deals going into their happy hour so enjoyed the best value. Service was very good with all the staff being friendly and attentive. Food was satisfying but the difference in dough between the garlic bread and pizza was a shame( or cooking style ? I do n’t know). Either way the garlic bread was perfect and soft but the pizza was crispy and dry. If the pizza base was as soft as the garlic bread this would be easy 5 star. The cocktail was nice but a bit heavy on the soda I think as it was a bit watered down and the flavour went fast Good value nevertheless, would probably pop in for garlic bread and a drink.",1,came here in the sweet spot around at the end of their lunch deals going into their happy hour so enjoyed the best value service was very good with all the staff being friendly and attentive food was satisfying but the difference in dough between the garlic bread and pizza was a shame or cooking style i do n t know either way the garlic bread was perfect and soft but the pizza was crispy and dry if the pizza base was as soft as the garlic bread this would be easy star the cocktail was nice but a bit heavy on the soda i think as it was a bit watered down and the flavour went fast good value nevertheless would probably pop in for garlic bread and a drink,come sweet spot around end lunch deal go happy hour enjoy best value service good staff friendly attentive food satisfy difference dough garlic bread pizza shame cook style n t know either way garlic bread perfect soft pizza crispy dry pizza base soft garlic bread would easy star cocktail nice bit heavy soda think bit water flavour go fast good value nevertheless would probably pop garlic bread drink
"Went to the Parkview today to meet up with friends who are back in town for Christmas. The beer garden is great but for some reason food was not allowed or being served outside today. I ca n't fathom why a pub would not want to serve food in their most popular area on one of the busiest days. To start off with, this is against RSA best practices and will almost certainly lead to more alcohol related incidents. In addition to this, they would have lost revenue and customers by not serving food where they were enjoying the venue.

"Had breakfast and for the price it's actually not bad plus super friendly service. Come check it out for their scrambled eggs which were REALLY good.

Coffee is nice. Nothing to shout home about though. The menu is super interesting and it looks like their "" thing "" is Chinese food. Will have to check it out again for dinner.

"We had a wonderful dinner at the Union Bank Restaurant in Orange, a charming place with a cozy decor and a friendly atmosphere. The restaurant offers a variety of dishes, from salads and pizzas to steaks and seafood, with a focus on local and seasonal produce. The wine list is impressive, featuring many wines from the Orange region and beyond. The highlight of our meals is always the prawn cocktail, a classic starter that was executed perfectly. We also enjoy a lot of the other dishes and starters. The service was excellent, attentive, and professional. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful, and made us feel welcome and comfortable. The food arrived promptly and was well-presented. The prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.

"Stayed at the accompanying motel overnight which was excellent. Had breakfast at the bistro the next morning. The initial welcome into the bistro was a bit indifferent …. but some of the staff seemed friendly others did n’t. I had granola with yogurt, a banana smoothie and a latte. The granola and banana smoothie( with syrup) was just ok. However the coffee was n’t great … it had a very harsh bitter initial flavour …. it was so bad i left it unfinished. My companion had waffles and a mango smoothie …. the waffle( looked like store bought) and was very dry and crumbly. There was a small smear of cream and a few lines of syrup over them adorned with maybe one strawberry. The mango smoothie had NO mango taste whatsoever they did try to rectify by adding more mango but still no flavour …. maybe they should taste their mango mix.

Had to ask multiple different staff members for expected ETA, each with a different answer, whom none of them actually followed up with the kitchen staff. My 6 year old daughter was given severely undercooked chicken karrage, and feeling lucky that i had noticed before she had eaten. We ended up leaving the restaurant hungry after spending over 200.

The room had all the necessary amenities, though there was n't much room in the bar fridge, as it was full of soft drink and alcohol bottles. The reception staff were excellent, both when checking in and checking out, ensuring that the transaction to refund the bond was put through immediately when checking out. A complimentary coffee voucher was given when checking in to be redeemed at the hotel cafe. There were also free movies that could be accessed in the room.",1,very good hotel located in the perth cbd close to the ferry terminals and railway stations the room was quite spacious and clean i found the bed comfortable the room had all the necessary amenities though there was n t much room in the bar fridge as it was full of soft drink and alcohol bottles the reception staff were excellent both when checking in and checking out ensuring that the transaction to refund the bond was put through immediately when checking out a complimentary coffee voucher was given when checking in to be redeemed at the hotel cafe there were also free movies that could be accessed in the room,good hotel locate perth cbd close ferry terminal railway station room quite spacious clean find bed comfortable room necessary amenity though n t much room bar fridge full soft drink alcohol bottle reception staff excellent check check ensure transaction refund bond put immediately check complimentary coffee voucher give check redeemed hotel cafe also free movie could access room
"The bundaburg Services Club is a place of nice music and wonderful workers as well as good prices for their food and services, unlike other establishments. The drinks were well made, and the bar workers were quick and efficient in their work. The woman behind the counter was wonderful and fast at taking orders. The view from the windows out the back had a gorgeous view. However, the plastic plants added to the look from upstairs near the bar but took the nice view from below and made them look out of place aswell as they are strict on their clothing policyno open shoes, thongs and no torn or dirty clothing. Ok, now for the important part, about 20 minutes after i ordered the food arrived at my table, the food I had, steak, chips, vegetables, and a breadroll. The steak was amazing and flavourful, but 400 The chips were bland then with salt turned from bland to impressive the odd thing, not much of a salt flavour after adding salt. The breadroll was well a bread roll it was cold but cooked and the butter was actually solid instead of liquid so plus points for that and finally the vegetables, sweet potato, pumpkin, carrot not as nice as the other food but healthy. Overall how nice and easy employees were to talk to. food speed of service drinks decorations Can 100 % recommend coming here for lunch or dinner",1,the bundaburg services club is a place of nice music and wonderful workers as well as good prices for their food and services unlike other establishments the drinks were well made and the bar workers were quick and efficient in their work the woman behind the counter was wonderful and fast at taking orders the view from the windows out the back had a gorgeous view however the plastic plants added to the look from upstairs near the bar but took the nice view from below and made them look out of place aswell as they are strict on their clothing policyno open shoes thongs and no torn or dirty clothing ok now for the important part about minutes after i ordered the food arrived at my table the food i had steak chips vegetables and a breadroll the steak was amazing and flavourful but the chips were bland then with salt turned from bland to impressive the odd thing not much of a salt flavour after adding salt the breadroll was well a bread roll it was cold but cooked and the butter was actually solid instead of liquid so plus points for that and finally the vegetables sweet potato pumpkin carrot not as nice as the other food but healthy overall how nice and easy employees were to talk to food speed of service drinks decorations can recommend coming here for lunch or dinner,bundaburg service club place nice music wonderful worker well good price food service unlike establishment drink well make bar worker quick efficient work woman behind counter wonderful fast take order view windows back gorgeous view however plastic plant add look upstairs near bar take nice view make look place aswell strict clothing policyno open shoe thongs no torn dirty clothing ok important part minute order food arrive table food steak chip vegetable breadroll steak amazing flavourful chip bland salt turn bland impressive odd thing not much salt flavour add salt breadroll well bread roll cold cook butter actually solid instead liquid plus point finally vegetables sweet potato pumpkin carrot not nice food healthy overall nice easy employee talk food speed service drink decoration recommend come lunch dinner

"Really enjoyed the pizzas. We had a Large Pepperoni and a Large BBQ Chicken w / Pineapple. The pepperoni was delicious, personally would have loved a little more pepperoni on it, but I think I said that about every pizza I ever had lol. The BBQ Chicken was topped heavily and had really great taste to it. The service I say was great, obviously there was some new staff on the counter and one appeared to be her first night and undergoing training, but wo n’t let detract from the overall score. Atmosphere was a bit flat, was very busy, but no seating for anyone to wait or eat in, hopefully this will change. I do like the hole in the wall approach but think it would be nice to have a bit more visibility into the kitchen and bring some of that vibe and atmosphere out into the open.

"We recently stayed at the Adina and I have to say we were thoroughly disappointed with the room we were allocated. The hotel was fully booked and I feel as though the room we were given should n't of been offered to guests. It smelled like dank, musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home, there was visible dust on the TV cabinet, and on the first night, our air conditioner did n't work. The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine. I wo n't be staying at this hotel or in the CBD for some time after this experience.",0,we recently stayed at the adina and i have to say we were thoroughly disappointed with the room we were allocated the hotel was fully booked and i feel as though the room we were given should n t of been offered to guests it smelled like dank musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home there was visible dust on the tv cabinet and on the first night our air conditioner did n t work the next morning the manager who was quick to respond to our request came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again at least it worked not only was the hotel in bad shape but the city too there is a tab just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people my son age dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the tab patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron they were about to get into a physical altercation we crossed the road very quickly we felt very unsafe the city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk all i could smell was human urine i wo n t be staying at this hotel or in the cbd for some time after this experience,recently stay adina say thoroughly disappointed room allocate hotel fully book feel though room give n t offer guest smell like dank musty cigarette could still smell clothes suitcases get home visible dust tv cabinet first night air conditioner n t work next morning manager quick respond request come room inspect kick unit get work least worked not hotel bad shape city tab downstairs accommodation attracts wrong type people son age dodge bicycle throw direction one tab patron yell swear another patron get physical altercation cross road quickly felt unsafe city housing many tough sleeping rough morning walk could smell human urine wo n t stay hotel cbd time experience

Very picturesque park situated on the banks of Maroochy river. Has a variety of swings and playground for the kids and bbq facilities. Also has the war memorial which is very nice.

Plenty of space for people of all ages to enjoy their own patch of grass. The water park is a highlight for kids and with its open layout it's easy to keep an eye on the little ones both in the splash area or while playing on the playground equipment. There is plenty of seating available( however more could be shaded) and with the edition of the public barbecues it's a location where just about everyone will enjoy. The toilets are clean and well maintained and the skatepark / bike tracks offer something for the older kids to enjoy too. It's quite evident that the council has invested considerable time and money into this location.,1,plenty of space for people of all ages to enjoy their own patch of grass the water park is a highlight for kids and with its open layout it is easy to keep an eye on the little ones both in the splash area or while playing on the playground equipment there is plenty of seating available however more could be shaded and with the edition of the public barbecues it is a location where just about everyone will enjoy the toilets are clean and well maintained and the skatepark bike tracks offer something for the older kids to enjoy too it is quite evident that the council has invested considerable time and money into this location,plenty space people age enjoy patch grass water park highlight kid open layout easy keep eye little one splash area play playground equipment plenty seat available however could shade edition public barbecue location everyone enjoy toilet clean well maintain skatepark bike track offer something old kid enjoy quite evident council invest considerable time money location
"While on a three-day break in Hervey Bay, we took a drive to Maryborough and stopped here for lunch on a Saturday. It's a lovely bright, open space overlooking a cool, shaded garden square. Plenty of seating, a fridge with drinks and sandwiches; order at counter and food is brought to your table. Staff were friendly, service prompt. We enjoyed a macadamia gelato shake,( him) and an iced latte( me). We shared the roast pumpkin and halloumi salad-tender, sweet pumpkin and( very, if not overdone) well-done halloumi-a great mix of sweet and savoury. Crunchy radish slices and greens were refreshing. Hot seasoned chips with aioli were crispy outside, tender inside, and a generous serving. We bought a Biscoff pot to takeaway for dessert later.( It was sweet and spicy and delicious.) We also stopped there on our way home on the Monday for a sandwich from the fridge and a cool drink. Sad to say my egg and lettuce sandwich was rather overpriced with thick, bland bread, not much filling, no ? mayo and just blaah. Hubby salad and ham wrap was better.

"The staff here are a real standout! They're friendly and hospitable. The atmosphere is cosy. Both the drink and food menu have a great variety. There is a large selection of desserts, all of which have been delicious when I've tried them. The tiramasu is especially good. And you must n't leave without the almond cookies. The food is presented very well, and the portions are perfect. We have tried a variety of dishes over the years. The prawn and caesar salad are particularly good. The pork options have been nice, too. The pizza toppings are great, and there are heaps of flavours. It would be even better if they were woodfire! Pricing is a little higher, but you kinda expect it, considering it's the only Italian place in town and popular.

"Very surprised and disappointed upon arrival compared to what you read on the internet. The parking is located offsite which feels very unsafe due to unhoused neighbours. Once you finally make the 5-10 minute walk back to the hotel, it is another 10 minutes to your room. When you have severe asthma this is not ideal. I wish the parking situation was a lot more clear at the point of check out. I would have reconsidered the location. In the event of an emergency( fire) the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building! The evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand. Both bed side lamps are faulty and almost zapped me when I turned the first one on. To top it all off 2 x dogs are located in the apartment below which bark every time you go out on the balcony. Not the 5 star stay I was hoping for. The room however is large and clean and the best part of the whole experience. Would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone.

Very delicious food and very nice ambience. The only reason I left one star less is because their lamb seekh kebab as in the second photo I thought were lacking the typical Indian / Pakistani flavour. Rest of all the dishes / food was very delicious and in true taste. The seekh kebab seemed like they toned the taste down to make them Aussie friendly which is fair but I think they pushed too far and removed all spices that are the essence of Seekh kebabs. I will return and hope they improve the Seekh kebab too as all the other items were mouth watering.

"Quaint LITTLE Cafe, absolutely awesome handpainted artwork adorning the walls, painted by female staff member who works out the back, and is apparently an ex-Circus Flame Thrower, tell you what, her artwork is hot Hot HOT! Such bright colours, imagination, creativity, thought, skill, talent and time has obviously gone into these beautiful works of art( paintings). Loved the ceiling and stained glass at top of Street view windows. Very small, busy, I would say thriving little Cafe. Apparently their Chicken & Leek Frittatas are absolutely amazing, and hefty sized great looking Caesar Salad delicious also. The Frittatas and Mini( muffin sized) Quiche were each( alone, with no side salad), nice looking foccacias each. Latte & Soy Latte were both of extremely good quality, strong, tasteful cuppas. Would call again, will be trying their huge Caesar Salad next time, at only! The menu had a couple of lesser prices on it, than current prices. Specials board behind the counter. Also offering healthy, tasty and beautifully presented smoothies. Simple, FREE and easy angle parking adjacent to St Georges Square, alternatively 15 minute kerbside parking right outside the door! Convenient location, easy to stop and grab a cuppa on your way to work or wherever. Phone box across the Street. Outside dining options, lovely frontage, prime location, easily accessible to all. A wonderful park across the street( St Georges Square), and also a great playground just over High Street, a simple, pleasant short walk away.

"This is a very good restaurant. It is not run by Japanese but does serve good Japanese inspired food.

The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. We ate in and one comment-please put some rubber stops on the bottom of the legs of the chairs to stop very painful scratching sounds when people move them to sit down.

"Visited on a Friday afternoon for a beer and dinner. We were quite surprised how quiet it was in the public bar. We had been there previously a number of years ago and the contrast was very noticeable. The staff in the restaurant were great and super friendly. The same ca n't be said about the bar staff in the public bar. Either they were having a bad day or perhaps they have been there too long but they were not friendly at all. Unfortunately the food in the restaurant was very average. I had the salmon which came with a generous serving of mashed sweet potato and some broccoli. The salmon was very dry and with no sauce. For 30, I would expect better standards than that. My colleague had the steak which a bit overcooked for medium. Overall, this establishment has not changed much over the years. Perhaps a refit is needed to liven the place up a bit.",0,visited on a friday afternoon for a beer and dinner we were quite surprised how quiet it was in the public bar we had been there previously a number of years ago and the contrast was very noticeable the staff in the restaurant were great and super friendly the same ca n t be said about the bar staff in the public bar either they were having a bad day or perhaps they have been there too long but they were not friendly at all unfortunately the food in the restaurant was very average i had the salmon which came with a generous serving of mashed sweet potato and some broccoli the salmon was very dry and with no sauce for i would expect better standards than that my colleague had the steak which a bit overcooked for medium overall this establishment has not changed much over the years perhaps a refit is needed to liven the place up a bit,visit friday afternoon beer dinner quite surprised quiet public bar previously number year ago contrast noticeable staff restaurant great super friendly ca n t say bar staff public bar either bad day perhaps long not friendly unfortunately food restaurant average salmon come generous serve mashed sweet potato broccoli salmon dry no sauce would expect good standard colleague steak bit overcooked medium overall establishment not change much year perhaps refit needed liven place bit

"My daughter recently visited me from interstate and later afternoon on a Sunday, we both wanted something to eat-having missed all the Cafes. Du Cane Brewery was a suggestion. So off we went. I walked past before, and thought it looked interesting and chill. The sort of place good to while away a slow Sunday afternoon … well, it did n’t disappoint. We asked for a Pizza recommendation and Forest was suggested. So we chose that and a Sopressa endowed one. I definitely thought the Sopressa Pizza was going to be the tastier one. I was wrong. The Forest, was tasty, moist and different. It was very delicious. The Sopressa was fine, but it was The Forest that really stood out! Of course we ordered too much, so we took home almost the equivalent of a whole Pizza. Which tasted great the next day, too! Loved the chill, but pretty bustling atmosphere. No hurrying here, and no rousting the customers after a certain time. We loved the pizza, the layout and our first coffees were pretty good too. Four stars only because second coffees were too milky and slopped in the saucer at serving. It fine. Love the kids area. Great initiative and really extends the place for everyone. Even four legged friends are welcome here. It so relaxed. There a style of seating for everyone and an ambience that is inviting and, most importantly, when the Cafes are closed for food-Du Cane has the goods. It was a lovely Sunday visit. And I definitely be taking my other daughter from interstate there too! She love it.

"The location is good, the room was decent but the lounge is incredibly uncomfortable and on the last night that I was there the air conditioner stopped turning on. The main problem I have with this place is the card system. It is one of those card insert systems but sometimes it does n't register your card for at least 3-4 times. One time I tried 7 times. This is SO frustrating when you get into the elevator and while you are trying to use the card someone on one of the top floors calls the elevator and then you are stuck in it riding it, going all the way to the top, then picking up any others that have called the elevator on the way down. What should be a 20 second trip to level 3 ends up being a 3 min scenic tour of the entire building.",0,the location is good the room was decent but the lounge is incredibly uncomfortable and on the last night that i was there the air conditioner stopped turning on the main problem i have with this place is the card system it is one of those card insert systems but sometimes it does n t register your card for at least times one time i tried times this is so frustrating when you get into the elevator and while you are trying to use the card someone on one of the top floors calls the elevator and then you are stuck in it riding it going all the way to the top then picking up any others that have called the elevator on the way down what should be a second trip to level ends up being a min scenic tour of the entire building,location good room decent lounge incredibly uncomfortable last night air conditioner stop turn main problem place card system one card insert system sometimes n t register card least time one time try time frustrate get elevator try use card someone one top floor call elevator stuck rid go way top picking others call elevator way second trip level end min scenic tour entire building

I really felt comfortable with the vibe here, which bustles, yet still feels relaxed The coffee was great and I enjoyed the Nasi Goreng( a particular favourite of mine), but felt( for my tastes) that it went a little heavy on the cabbage in it. Would have liked some chilli on it too … after all, Indonesian food with no chilli ? I had a delightful, special late lunch here, which was so atmospheric too.

"Bugger all light in the car park at night. Pretty disappointed about the place. It smelt clean but I've never felt so dirty / unhygienic being in a public space. EVERY BALL is chipped which sent us to the Gutter almost every bowl. Lanes are very short and thin. Lanes looked barely oiled. Basically everything in there was paint chipped or damaged in some way, not nice to see for a new place. We ended up only paying for 1 game because it was such a disappointment to watch the balls literally bounce down because of the chips and dents. The lounges were really nice and the staff were nice too.:) For the same price, you can go to Sunset Super Bowl and have nice clean balls and a better experience.",0,bugger all light in the car park at night pretty disappointed about the place it smelt clean but i have never felt so dirty unhygienic being in a public space every ball is chipped which sent us to the gutter almost every bowl lanes are very short and thin lanes looked barely oiled basically everything in there was paint chipped or damaged in some way not nice to see for a new place we ended up only paying for game because it was such a disappointment to watch the balls literally bounce down because of the chips and dents the lounges were really nice and the staff were nice too for the same price you can go to sunset super bowl and have nice clean balls and a better experience,bugger light car park night pretty disappointed place smelt clean never felt dirty unhygienic public space every ball chip send u gutter almost every bowl lanes short thin lane look barely oil basically everything paint chip damage way not nice see new place end pay game disappointment watch ball literally bounce chip dent lounge really nice staff nice price go sunset super bowl nice clean ball well experience

Never had fried eggs before! Delicious. The hardest part about this venue is trying to find where to enter. Both doors say( use other main entrance) ….. an arrow on the side door near the “ main entry ” might be helpful to point people through the main door with no signage( I almost walked away). Glad I persisted as it was a memorable breakfast and good coffee. I did sit in restaurant with an empty water glass for close to an hour and the venue was n’t busy. When I asked where to pay the waiter said “ do it on the way out ” in a short sharp tone even though he was next to a cashier.

The whole loaf fell apart when trying to take a slice as the middle was still wet and gluggy. I do n’t like slamming small business, but i also do n’t like wasting money.

"First time at Neighbourhood today. Went down with my life, little girl( 2) and our friend with 2 kids of her own. Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly. Finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid 7 for the cookie and a total of 55 for not a great product. Could have been and did expect a mich better overall experience at Neighbourhood today. I am debating about going back....

"Surprisingly easy to navigate safely( given its size), Victoria Square Tarntanyangga is a gathering place as much as it is an artery for movement through the city. Many events are received and / or hosted here( including sports events and holiday festivals). The parks are nice and many people recreate; partaking in health, fitness and family activities throughout the day. Victoria Square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful. More native vegetation would be appreciated but the open spaces must be preserved for practical reasons. One other thing worth noting is the cooling effect of this green open space. It is significant and airflow is definitely increased within the city because of it, which is important because Adelaide is prone to hot summers.",1,surprisingly easy to navigate safely given its size victoria square tarntanyangga is a gathering place as much as it is an artery for movement through the city many events are received and or hosted here including sports events and holiday festivals the parks are nice and many people recreate partaking in health fitness and family activities throughout the day victoria square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful more native vegetation would be appreciated but the open spaces must be preserved for practical reasons one other thing worth noting is the cooling effect of this green open space it is significant and airflow is definitely increased within the city because of it which is important because adelaide is prone to hot summers,surprisingly easy navigate safely give size victoria square tarntanyangga gather place much artery movement city many event receive hosted include sport event holiday festival park nice many people recreate partake health fitness family activity throughout day victoria square place respite busy office worker look stunningly beautiful native vegetation would appreciate open space must preserve practical reason one thing worth note cool effect green open space significant airflow definitely increase within city important adelaide prone hot summer

"All was wonderful. The meat is to devour. The gyros wrap is a generous fill of flavour. With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future.

The waitstaff were lovely and it a cosy restaurant.

The rice with Chicken curry and pappad also was bland. The Biriyani was also average. I would have given good ratings for this place, regardless of the long wait, if the food was good. It sad that the previous ratings are luring customers like me to this cafe but get cheated with the average food. Owners, please improve the quality and taste of the food.

I noticed that items listed for on the online menu, were written down as 19 on the pad our order was written down on.

"The coffees were really nice. I was disappointed with their Eggs Benedict. I'm a weirdo that loves ham but not bacon. So I ordered it with ham( there is an option for bacon that costs extra). When it was served it looked like bacon and we worked up the courage to query it. They said that's just what the ham option looks like. I know it's shaped like sliced ham, but it tasted exactly like bacon. It was crispy and very salty, and sadly it was mostly left on my plate at the end. So if you want the bacon flavour at no extra cost, just get the ham.

"A lovely Cafe is hidden on a side street of Mandurah. I do n't like crowds much, so this was a perfect spot for me to grab breakfast and a coffee. The outside and inside of the Cafe were clean and I loved the decor and furnishings. The young man who took my order was very polite. He gave me a wooden box with a number on it. In it was the cutlery, a serviette and salt and pepper. I ordered and went to sit outside in the sun. I did not have to wait long before my coffee then my breakfast came out. A couple who ordered after me and sat at a table behind me was asked if their meal was okay by a waitress. This made me feel a little uncomfortable as I was not asked at all.

Parmas had obviously been cooked earlier and re fried as ordered. Burnt crust, dry old looking chicken inside. One replacement parma was no better the so rather than wait again the person just left it. Wait staff apologised and provided excellent service, Meals arrived in drbs and drabs, and it was only a Tuesday night, not a busy Saturday night.

"The line is incredibly long. Expect to wait an hour if you go after 10 pm. Also they cutoff their custom cocktails 40-50 minutes and sometimes an hour before they close at 1 am, so basically when they choose, because of some rule they could n't explain thoroughly to me. It's weird cause they still offer hard liquor drinks at 11AUD per pour. Does n't make sense. The vibe here is decent. I'd say this spot is best for a day party. They have different DJs and an accepting, open vibe where everyone is accepted no matter race, religion, or orientation. Everyone just wants to listen to good music or makeout haha Note: They wo n't let people in 30min before close and the bar is petty much open air with a rooftop so it's subject to the weather.",0,the line is incredibly long expect to wait an hour if you go after pm also they cutoff their custom cocktails minutes and sometimes an hour before they close at am so basically when they choose because of some rule they could n t explain thoroughly to me it is weird because they still offer hard liquor drinks at aud per pour does n t make sense the vibe here is decent i would say this spot is best for a day party they have different djs and an accepting open vibe where everyone is accepted no matter race religion or orientation everyone just wants to listen to good music or makeout haha note they wo n t let people in min before close and the bar is petty much open air with a rooftop so it is subject to the weather,line incredibly long expect wait hour go pm also cutoff custom cocktail minute sometimes hour close basically choose rule could n t explain thoroughly weird still offer hard liquor drink aud per pour n t make sense vibe decent would say spot best day party different dj accept open vibe everyone accept no matter race religion orientation everyone want listen good music makeout haha note wo n t let people min close bar petty much open air rooftop subject weather

"I had a really good chai latte here with good flavour and temperature. I stayed a while with a friend and grabbed a matcha latte to takeaway at the end of my visit but it was n't very hot unfortunately, but was made by the same lady. Hot drinks are a reasonable price at for a large. No discount for bringing my reusable cup but a good price nevertheless. The Eggs Benedict and the other food all looked amazing-quality ingredients and well presented on the plate. The date brownie dessert from the fridge was nearly 8 for quite a small piece so I passed-but it looked delicious. Prices in the fridge would perhaps entice me to buy something next time. I like to know what I'm buying and how much it will cost me without having to ask the waitress about every item I'm interested in and hold up people behind me by taking up the staff valuable time. The beetroot latte sounded interesting. Service was friendly. Beware of the European wasps out the back which go for your food / sugary drinks and buzz around you. We moved inside and thankfully they did n't follow us. I would like to suggest they get an exterminator to find and kill the nearby nest of this aggressive, introduced species of wasp. Air conditioning was comfortable, as was the booth seating. It is dog-friendly out the back. Plenty of street parking in the area. Could be a good place to sit and work on a laptop for a couple of hours, but I did n't notice any powerpoints so my go-to would still be Maccas for longer stints.

"No working fan or ventilation in the bathroom( see photo with open vent full of dust bunnies to fall on you as you shower) which possibly explains the mold in the shower and the musty smell of the room.

Only been once as a big yugioh fan. Great selection of cards and stuff but rudeness is crazy. Pulling faces and arguing over things that do n't matter. After reading a couple of the owners replies to other reviews I can see he is just a rude guy that refuses to accept any responsibility. Other staff member I met was nice but overshadowed by that guy.

"Cute small bakery. All the items look very beautiful and delicate.

"We had the pleasure of dining at Hungry Monkey on a Saturday morning after a short hike with the family. We were greeted by a friendly staff and loved the graffiti around the cafe. The open concept cafe gives a pleasant amount of morning sun, however, it can get a little warm later in the morning. Their fluffy hotcakes were beautifully plated with fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, edible flowers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was topped with a generous amount of custard which made the hot cakes a tad too sweet for my liking. The malteser shake could not be finished as it was too sweet for my liking. The chilli scrambled eggs were savoury and perfectly seasoned. It is really delightful to pair those eggs with sliced avocado and slightly toasted sourdough. It was overall an enjoyable experience. Definitely a gem in the Bowral town!",1,we had the pleasure of dining at hungry monkey on a saturday morning after a short hike with the family we were greeted by a friendly staff and loved the graffiti around the cafe the open concept cafe gives a pleasant amount of morning sun however it can get a little warm later in the morning their fluffy hotcakes were beautifully plated with fruits nuts coconut flakes edible flowers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream this was topped with a generous amount of custard which made the hot cakes a tad too sweet for my liking the malteser shake could not be finished as it was too sweet for my liking the chilli scrambled eggs were savoury and perfectly seasoned it is really delightful to pair those eggs with sliced avocado and slightly toasted sourdough it was overall an enjoyable experience definitely a gem in the bowral town,pleasure din hungry monkey saturday morning short hike family greet friendly staff love graffiti around cafe open concept cafe give pleasant amount morning sun however get little warm later morning fluffy hotcake beautifully plat fruit nut coconut flake edible flower scoop vanilla ice cream top generous amount custard make hot cake tad sweet like malteser shake could not finish sweet like chilli scramble eggs savoury perfectly season really delightful pair egg slice avocado slightly toast sourdough overall enjoyable experience definitely gem bowral town

"A lovely little Italian-we arrived without a booking and managed to get a seat, but I recommend booking beforehand to ensure you get a spot as there are n’t many tables at this restaurant. The staff are welcoming, although we did feel a little rushed to order. The food took quite a while, but it was delicious when it arrived. We had a white pizza( essentially cheesy garlic bread), I had salmon fettuccine and partner had a creamy marinara seafood spaghetti. They were well presented and well cooked-for me personally, a little too much lemon used in my dish but by no means made it unpleasant. We also had a couple of glasses of red wine which was really nice. The atmosphere was lively and inviting. As well as eating in, they offer takeaway and there was a steady stream of customers coming in to collect orders in the hour and 30 mins( or so) that we were there, so it obviously a popular spot. Toilets are out the back of the restaurant, which felt a little strange to get to-you go through a door from the main restaurant and into a sort of courtyard where there a lot of restaurant items but the facilities were clean and well kept. I recommend to go here, lovely food and atmosphere and relatively well priced.",1,a lovely little italian we arrived without a booking and managed to get a seat but i recommend booking beforehand to ensure you get a spot as there are n t many tables at this restaurant the staff are welcoming although we did feel a little rushed to order the food took quite a while but it was delicious when it arrived we had a white pizza essentially cheesy garlic bread i had salmon fettuccine and partner had a creamy marinara seafood spaghetti they were well presented and well cooked for me personally a little too much lemon used in my dish but by no means made it unpleasant we also had a couple of glasses of red wine which was really nice the atmosphere was lively and inviting as well as eating in they offer takeaway and there was a steady stream of customers coming in to collect orders in the hour and mins or so that we were there so it obviously a popular spot toilets are out the back of the restaurant which felt a little strange to get to you go through a door from the main restaurant and into a sort of courtyard where there a lot of restaurant items but the facilities were clean and well kept i recommend to go here lovely food and atmosphere and relatively well priced,lovely little italian arrive without book manage get seat recommend book beforehand ensure get spot n t many table restaurant staff welcome although feel little rush order food take quite delicious arrive white pizza essentially cheesy garlic bread salmon fettuccine partner creamy marinara seafood spaghetti well present well cook personally little much lemon use dish no mean make unpleasant also couple glass red wine really nice atmosphere lively invite well eat offer takeaway steady stream customer come collect order hour min obviously popular spot toilet back restaurant felt little strange get go door main restaurant sort courtyard lot restaurant item facility clean well keep recommend go lovely food atmosphere relatively well price

"Decorated with a profusion of flowers, both real and fake, the Cafe Toscana in Forster must be one of the most cheerful-looking establishments in Australia. Once you step inside, the service is friendly and attentive and nothing seems to be a problem. I feel kind of mean, only giving them 4 stars, but there was just something that was n't quite "" right "". Apart from the overwhelming clutter that passes for decor, we really enjoyed our meal, choosing 3 items from the smaller tapas menu and a salad, instead of having a main. The Chili mussels were kind of small and did n't quite make it to "" perfect "" level despite a tasty and nicely hot sauce. The arancini balls were smushy inside, instead of distinctly "" risotto-like "". The garlic prawns were to die for... tender, plump, huge and tasty. But the thing that really intrigued me was the salad, which was "" bean, heads of broccoli and peas "". A quick read of the menu seemed to indicate that these three are the only green vegetables the chef knows how to prepare. They appeared on the other menu options. As my hubby says..., broccoli and peas must have been cheap this. There was nothing wrong exactly. All the food was tasty and well-presented. There was just something undefinable missing. But do n't get me wrong... The Toscana is busy and popular and it did n't disappoint.

I forgot to ask for breakfast in a meal so asked at the window if we could do so. The amount of attitude we got for making a innocent mistake. She did n't even do her job by up selling in a meal deal. I was even to scared to ask for a flat white as she hissed at me cappuccino! ?.

Update. I used to Love the latte coffee I got it most days on the way to or home. But this week was a disaster. I waited 20 mins for a coffee inside. Everyone got theor stuff & I could n't get anyone attention. When the girl finally asked a you still waiting for your latte a single one latte I said are sure I am she disappeared and then came back within a second with the cold coffee and said sorry the machine was n't working. I'm not sure I'm going to make this my go-to place anymore because this is not the first time this is about the third time in as many weeks this has happened so clearly a big turn around which is a real pity.

"While the food undoubtedly stole the show, I must admit that the service experience at Hogs Breath left a bit to be desired. However, it is essential to highlight that this in no way overshadowed the overall positive experience. The servers were friendly and polite, but at times it seemed as though they were stretched thin, resulting in slightly longer wait times and occasional lapses in attention. With a little more attention to detail and the addition of more staff members, I am confident that the service could be improved significantly.",1,while the food undoubtedly stole the show i must admit that the service experience at hogs breath left a bit to be desired however it is essential to highlight that this in no way overshadowed the overall positive experience the servers were friendly and polite but at times it seemed as though they were stretched thin resulting in slightly longer wait times and occasional lapses in attention with a little more attention to detail and the addition of more staff members i am confident that the service could be improved significantly,food undoubtedly steal show must admit service experience hog breath leave bit desired however essential highlight no way overshadow overall positive experience server friendly polite time seem though stretch thin result slightly longer wait time occasional lapse attention little attention detail addition staff member confident service could improve significantly

"I try to only write reviews when the food and place is great. Sadly this is not the case with our experience at Frigg in Nerang. I review only in the hope that lessons are learnt as we really value having a local shop such as Frigg in our midst and the potential is there. The staff were friendly and cheerful... just what you need to start the day. There were few people in when we were but our wait for meals was long... 25mins ? THe tea came in a plunger set up but the plunger had been put down so the tea was weak as tap water. The poached eggs were badly over cooked. The "" toast "" was bread basically. The hash brown was miniscule and was cold. I mean we were not going to die but come on.... basic stuff I would think. We probably will return as I said we need places in Nerang.

"Heard this was Rockhampton high-end dining, but ended up very disappointed. Sure, similarly expensive to nearby restaurants and similarly substandard too. Not sure whether they're trying to go fine dining, family-orientated, or small business-like. They fail in any category. Food is not terrible. In fact it was n't bad by my taste. Still far, far below my expectations for what I was told was fine dining. Some elements did not seem very freshly made. Summing, poor quality control. Served by a very polite waitress who tried her best and I can appreciate that. Not tablecloth, but you can not try themselves for not being trained. The atmosphere is terrible. I almost thought to call it rustic, but that's simply trying to reframe outdated and worn out. Other diners were not the type with etiquette, who looked like they were deciding between here and a cheap substitute. T-shirts and sports shorts mainly, or walking down from the hotel in slides.

We were going to stay for a main, but we're nervous that sauce would be on the main as well( it was n't on the gyozas and they were absolutely lovely but again, the sauce it did come with was a little odd).

"We had a great time, our party host was fantastic, the party room can get a little overwhelming and would be great to have the middle wall closed when so many parties are happening. We booked a late session on Saturday as we were advised that would be the best time of day with a few children having sensory issues and were told we likely have to room to ourselves. There was a lot of parties on, I think it would be a great idea to stagger the times each party are in eating and having cake. My son had to get out of the room as soon as his cake was done, as the noise from the neighbouring party was very overwhelming with popping balloons, shouting / screaming. Apart from this I would 100 % recommend a party at time zone Eva was amazing and the party was great value.",1,we had a great time our party host was fantastic the party room can get a little overwhelming and would be great to have the middle wall closed when so many parties are happening we booked a late session on saturday as we were advised that would be the best time of day with a few children having sensory issues and were told we likely have to room to ourselves there was a lot of parties on i think it would be a great idea to stagger the times each party are in eating and having cake my son had to get out of the room as soon as his cake was done as the noise from the neighbouring party was very overwhelming with popping balloons shouting screaming apart from this i would recommend a party at time zone eva was amazing and the party was great value,great time party host fantastic party room get little overwhelm would great middle wall close many party happen book late session saturday advise would best time day child sensory issue tell likely room lot party think would great idea stagger time party eat cake son get room soon cake do noise neighbour party overwhelm pop balloon shout scream apart would recommend party time zone eva amaze party great value
"This outlet is in the same location as the now defunct 2TG Thai was located in. Convenient location at Red Edge, no issues with parking. Food-BIR style curry that's prevalent in Australia( standard curry base which is built upon to order). Beef Bhuna with garlic naan. The flavour profile of the Bhuna was quite good-heat was on point and well spiced. Texturally sound as well( I dislike overly smooth gravies, which this fortunately is n't). Cumin forward on the flavour profile( quite dominant). Whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet-Bhuna is a dry curry and I wish it was n't served drowned in gravy. Maybe this is what other customers prefer-I like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid. The naan was a little disappointing, lacking the smoky tandoor flavour I'm used to, and there was n't a pronounced garlic flavour. Service-absolutely lovely. Both the lady serving and the gentleman in the kitchen were smiling and welcoming. Atmosphere-what I would expect for a small Indian outlet. Clean and well attended to.",1,this outlet is in the same location as the now defunct tg thai was located in convenient location at red edge no issues with parking food bir style curry that is prevalent in australia standard curry base which is built upon to order beef bhuna with garlic naan the flavour profile of the bhuna was quite good heat was on point and well spiced texturally sound as well i dislike overly smooth gravies which this fortunately is n t cumin forward on the flavour profile quite dominant whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet bhuna is a dry curry and i wish it was n t served drowned in gravy maybe this is what other customers prefer i like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid the naan was a little disappointing lacking the smoky tandoor flavour i am used to and there was n t a pronounced garlic flavour service absolutely lovely both the lady serving and the gentleman in the kitchen were smiling and welcoming atmosphere what i would expect for a small indian outlet clean and well attended to,outlet location defunct tg thai locate convenient location red edge no issue park food bir style curry prevalent australia standard curry base build upon order beef bhuna garlic naan flavour profile bhuna quite good heat point well spice texturally sound well dislike overly smooth gravy fortunately n t cumin forward flavour profile quite dominant whilst not exclusively issue outlet bhuna dry curry wish n t serve drowned gravy maybe customer prefer like fry kadahi minimal liquid naan little disappointing lack smoky tandoor flavour use n t pronounce garlic flavour service absolutely lovely lady serve gentleman kitchen smile welcome atmosphere would expect small indian outlet clean well attend

Gourmet hotdog Mexican dog my foot it had 1 bean a couple bits of corn and a dirty boiled hotdog you get in a 12 pack from woollies and the roll was not much better and not even warmed very disappointing for 9. The only saving grace for this place was the loaded chicken fries were nice same with the onion ring.

The young man serving us was great, very friendly and checked us multiple times we were n't left waiting. The food was average, bland and had no flavor. The seasoning on meats was basic to none, if you like the taste of straight unseasoned meat this place is for you. The coleslaw and creamy garlic sauce had no flavor at all.

"Wow, what an experience. More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg. Do yourself a favour, go around the block and take advantage of Maccas or Hungry Jacks. At least you know what you will get there.",0,wow what an experience more than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown no greeting or instructions so we grabbed our own table and waited fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table menu collected and choices decided went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive underwhelming at best packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread a request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain again i should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently bacon was ordinary hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect hence the two stars one for each egg do yourself a favour go around the block and take advantage of maccas or hungry jacks at least you know what you will get there,wow experience hour wait breakfast probably need take blame ordered extravagant menu choice bacon egg hash brown no greet instruction grab table wait fifteen minute later obvious probably need get menus none table menu collect choice decide go counter order still no greet apart couple grunt whilst coffee make order provide hour wait food arrive underwhelming best package butter place balsamic glaze make experience much good sticky finger butter toast experience hole bread bread request salt pepper meet look distain trust chef quality establishment season food sufficiently bacon ordinary hash brown flavour three month old oil poach eggs near perfect hence two star one egg favour go around block take advantage maccas hungry jack least know get

"I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n’t find a good enough reason to. Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n’t finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies.

We have stayed at the hotel several times over the last 20 years and unfortunately this time was the worst and as such we will not return in the future. The pool was not heated and whilst it was open was not tolerable due to the intense cold temperature. I noted only a couple of kids who braved the water whilst we were there. We did try and lasted only a couple of minutes. We deliberately booked the hotel due to the indoor heated pool over an Airbnb house as we both have medical conditions in which we need to regularly rehab in the pool. The one time we did brave it we were in more pain when we got out. Additionally the bar fridge made so much noice that at night we slept with the tv on to drown out the noise of the fridge. Our room was cleaned daily however was not vacuumed the entire time we were there as dirt on the carpet was there when we arrived and there when we left. Overall a very disappointing experience.

"It's not the best kebabs in the world but it's the best in Dalby for sure.

I would never order it again, far too plain and boring. The customer service was excellent. The only issue I noticed throughout the night was that everyone in the restaurant that had ordered pizza was waiting for their meals for a while, which was really annoying because most people came with their partners, so whoever ordered pasta would get that first, and then whoever ordered pizza would get it 10mins later-which defeats the purpose of eating together at a restaurant.

My take away from my visit to this museum( that stands on the site of the first governor house that was built by Governor Phillip-the first governor of Sydney and the man that led the first 11 ships to bring convicts over from England) is this: if every other Governor and leader had behaved like Governor Phillip to the indigenous people then we would have avoided much of the pains that followed in the colonisation of this island. A beautiful museum and a great place to go to get a good introduction to the history of Sydney and indeed the birth of Australia. And it is free and has a good coffee shop / cafe.,1,my take away from my visit to this museum that stands on the site of the first governor house that was built by governor phillip the first governor of sydney and the man that led the first ships to bring convicts over from england is this if every other governor and leader had behaved like governor phillip to the indigenous people then we would have avoided much of the pains that followed in the colonisation of this island a beautiful museum and a great place to go to get a good introduction to the history of sydney and indeed the birth of australia and it is free and has a good coffee shop cafe,take away visit museum stand site first governor house build governor phillip first governor sydney man lead first ship bring convict england every governor leader behave like governor phillip indigenous people would avoid much pain follow colonisation island beautiful museum great place go get good introduction history sydney indeed birth australia free good coffee shop cafe

"2 times in a week, easy to find, flat atmosphere. Staff were nice guys, but the service is slow and lacking, and the food is sloppy and flavourless. In all my meals, I had dishes that tasted like old freezer stock or rancid. Other parts that should be cooked well were not and other parts that should not be cooked were over done.

"Stayed 5 nights to visit relatives in the area. Huge room that could easily have a King sized bed, lounge and small dining table and chairs. Immaculately clean and housekeeping were attentive and super friendly. Air-conditioning was good too. Room equipped with fridge. Microwave, kettle, toaster, utensils, crockery, glasses, dishwashing liquid, wash cloth and teatowel. Extra towels, pillows and blankets too. Bed satisfactory although a little firm. Two seater sofa bed, lounge chair and two standard chairs and huge TV. Very happy with room. Not enough parking for all rooms but easy to park opposite side of carpark with provided parking permit. Negatives: Fridge loud overnight. Traffic noisy early morning. Lots of tradies stsying so leaving early. Not a place to sleep in. Requested an Upstairs, quiet room at an end. Got Room 2 downstairs with noisy, inconsiderate people above who's child was running around until and riding her scooter along the balcony. One night it started at! Would we stay here again-possibly.

Tried this place because it came recommended by my parents. I enjoyed the Chicken 65 buriyani. The Chicken 65 was soo tasty. Everything was tasty it sure cleared my sinuses with the right amount of spices. I really liked the appetiser of the Puri filled tamarind chutney and yogurt. Soo good. Enjoyed saag paneer and did n’t really have time goat curry as the buriyani was enough. I got that for my aunt. Loved the roti and naans even if a bit over priced. The food is definitely tasty and nice. However a bit pricey. I always think Indian food is pricey. But I could have ordered only 1 buriyani. I downloaded the app to get reward points and 5 off. My bill was still I did take all the leftovers home. Waiters were very nice and food came out fast. So sad there was n’t tea left to order.,1,tried this place because it came recommended by my parents i enjoyed the chicken buriyani the chicken was soo tasty everything was tasty it sure cleared my sinuses with the right amount of spices i really liked the appetiser of the puri filled tamarind chutney and yogurt soo good enjoyed saag paneer and did n t really have time goat curry as the buriyani was enough i got that for my aunt loved the roti and naans even if a bit over priced the food is definitely tasty and nice however a bit pricey i always think indian food is pricey but i could have ordered only buriyani i downloaded the app to get reward points and off my bill was still i did take all the leftovers home waiters were very nice and food came out fast so sad there was n t tea left to order,tried place come recommended parent enjoy chicken buriyani chicken soo tasty everything tasty sure clear sinus right amount spice really like appetiser puri fill tamarind chutney yogurt soo good enjoy saag paneer n t really time goat curry buriyani enough get aunt love roti naan even bit price food definitely tasty nice however bit pricey always think indian food pricey could order buriyani download app get reward point bill still take leftover home waiter nice food come fast sad n t tea leave order

Went to this place during tulip festival. It is small park. This is my first visit here. This is onetime place to visit. There are few stalls in this gardens. Honey taste is good. We visited on weekend. I feel crowd is more than flowers. Ticket cost for adult is For kids under 12 it is free. Not a worth to visit second time. Initially thought of going to Canberra tulip show but ended of going here as we need to come back to Sydney on same day. I have to 5 star to Bowral city. There is also music concert in this garden however less people interested. I think most of people came for photos not to enjoy nature..

"This Korean barbecue restaurant holds sentimental value for me as it was the first place I dined out upon arriving in Brisbane several years ago. While I've noticed a slight decline in food quality since then, the experience is still worth revisiting.

"AMAZING FOOD-GREAT PRICES I ordered the lamb salad and they were kind enough to substitute the lamb for chicken. So much variety and flavours in the salad. Very impressed. We sat outside as there were 6 of us but the stools were a bit uncomfortable to sit on, so not ideal for older people who need chairs with a back. So when booking, request chairs with backs if you need them. I do recommend booking if it the weekend as they were incredibly busy and it was the middle of winter. They have gluten free options available and our friends shared a gf chicken pizza and said it was delicious. If you outside, wait for table service as it can take a while to be served at the bar inside. The toilets were quite cramped, and there were only 2 of them. But clean enough.

"Lovely American BBQ joint. Loved the atmosphere it like industrial / western, lots of American style decor earthy tones and very cozy We got Brisket, cheesey kransky, chicken, Mac n chees and Big Mac Fries BRISKET: was on point. Tender, juicy with perfect bark and smoke ring. Could be me but I like a more seasoned rub. Smokey but coulda used a bit more bite, salt n pepper. At this point in my American bbq food journey I after a truly outstanding brisket to give out the 5 star rating. CHICKEN: tender and held a decent moisture. Great flavours of the rub made it through the skin and to the meat. CHEESEY KRANSKY: The winner of day. This kransky had the best snap of any kransky I ever had. Amazing flavour profile and perfectly juicy. Great bite to it. MAC N CHEESE: pretty basic flavour profile and sauce. Still looking for the perfect mac n cheese BIG MAC LOADED FRIES: lovely dry n flavoured burnt ends to cut through the fries. Sauce and lettuce added a pretty accurate flavour to the dish being homaged. Overall we were very happy with B Town BBQ experience.

"The service here is lovely. Our waiter, Adrian, made sure that we were happy throughout the night. He also answered the many questions we had about some menu items. One of the staff reached over my shoulder to grab something off of my table and bumped me, which was a bit uncomfortable. The food was fantastic. All the pasta dishes were absolutely amazing, possibly the best pasta I ever had. One of the people from our party said it might even be the best meal she ever had. The deserts were lovely, but I do n’t think it is necessarily worth the price. As a whole, it was an expensive meal but I would say it was worth the money for a very rare visit to a fancy place. Just be aware of the price of water: 12 a bottle. The normal table water was warm and just did n’t taste good, which I never experienced before. That forced us to get still water, which was what ended up costing more.

"Very modern, great bar and restaurant to visit very tasty food, in particular the egg plant chips with an Asian twist on it! We enjoyed cocktails and a game of bowling with the family, and games! Was very impressed with the great young male staff members and an older male, great service and attitudes! Only did n’t give full stars as we stayed at the mantra and wanted to grab morning coffee from there but they do n’t do morning more pizza options could be great, But otherwise drinks and lunch were yummy and massive kids meals servings which was great, next time 1 kids meal could feed 2 young kids!

"The food here is decent and so is the environment. Generally everything I had here has been good but in this review I be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day. The prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than I prefer. Personally I like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour, but that just me. The prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though. The steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked. The meat was n’t as warm as I liked and the caramelised onions were n’t as flavoursome as they looked to be. Overall you could n’t taste much else and the sandwich( 22 I think) was only half a sandwich. Would have liked the whole thing for that price. The chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain. Tasted like there was n’t any seasoning at all on them. A jug of lemon-lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better. Will have to write another review the next time I visit.",1,the food here is decent and so is the environment generally everything i had here has been good but in this review i be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day the prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than i prefer personally i like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour but that just me the prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though the steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked the meat was n t as warm as i liked and the caramelised onions were n t as flavoursome as they looked to be overall you could n t taste much else and the sandwich i think was only half a sandwich would have liked the whole thing for that price the chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain tasted like there was n t any seasoning at all on them a jug of lemon lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better will have to write another review the next time i visit,food decent environment generally everything good review discuss particular dish particular day prawn pasta good however much watery prefer personally like sauce thicker concentrate flavour prawn tomato pasta ratio pretty good though steak sandwich little underwhelming consider good look meat n t warm like caramelised onion n t flavoursome look overall could n t taste much else sandwich think half sandwich would like whole thing price chip perfectly crunchy fluffy however plain taste like n t season jug lemon lime bitter pretty worth say food usually well write another review next time visit

Ordered pizzas on Friday night with a group of friends. Placed order at and was told it would be delivered within 35 to 40 minutes. At I phoned again asking where our order was. I was told they had a delivery issue with their delivery crew and that the pizzas would be delivered within the next 35 minutes. What a joke. We finally got our delivery at which was nearly cold when we opened the boxes. I agree with previous reviews by people that they are cooked when you order them and then they sit somewhere until they are delivered. I would not be recommending Domino delivery service to anyone and certainly wo n't be using them again for entertaining visitors or friends.

It was small, but there was enough equipment to keep most kids happy. Next to the park is a skate park, where there are older children and teens. Picnic tables: there are a few scattered around, but come early in the day if you want to snag one. Boat launch: small to medium-sized craft can get to the river here.

"I absolutely DO NOT recommend staying here-the whole place needs gutted and redone. Absolutely filthy and very run down. Apparently there was a flood recently so there is a bad smell-a bit like urine.

Whilst this is n’t the hostels fault, they make no effort to even warn you about this as I would have tried to get to sleep before the roadworks began if warned, they could also do things like offer free earplugs( I had my own but this feels like bare minimum, you can still hear the roadworks clearly through them) or just acknowledge it in some way! Windows are also not fit for purpose so do nothing to reduce the noise.

Many years since I eaten KFC. Had a need to get a quick take away lunch. Bought two extra hot chicken pieces and two medium fries. The chicken was terrible. Dry and tasteless. Fries were just soggy chips. I since looked online and there are hundreds or more complaints about exactly what we were sold and across Australia not just Maroochydore. The chicken was so overcooked there was no fluid to be had and it seemed like all the liquid drained out of the chicken was poured onto the soggy horrible fries.

"I stopped by for breakfast-eggs benedict with bacon, and a latte. The eggs benedict sounded expensive at first, but turned out to be worth it because the serving size was huge.

"Finally got to their Rhursday morning breakfast. Of course ordered Eggs Benedict with crispy bacon, Carrot & Ginger fresh press juice, Long Black coffee, my friend had Eggs Benedict with salmon, & caramel latte. Service was quick & friendly, the juice was tasty, I personally would lived more Ginger but that's personal preference, same re my coffee, I love strong coffee & usually ask for extra shot, but it was pleasant, my friend said their latte was very good. The Eggs Benedict were both tasty and generous serves with the eggs cooked perfectly, my bacon came crispy as asked & a generous serving of salmon on the other. I like how the sourdough was t too thick. Overall I was very happy with the food and service, bringing family back so we can do the grazing plate. Also, live how a staff member brought out a bowl of water for a dog who was sitting patiently while his owner ate, Happy to recommend and visit again, as plenty on the menu to try.",1,finally got to their rhursday morning breakfast of course ordered eggs benedict with crispy bacon carrot ginger fresh press juice long black coffee my friend had eggs benedict with salmon caramel latte service was quick friendly the juice was tasty i personally would lived more ginger but that is personal preference same re my coffee i love strong coffee usually ask for extra shot but it was pleasant my friend said their latte was very good the eggs benedict were both tasty and generous serves with the eggs cooked perfectly my bacon came crispy as asked a generous serving of salmon on the other i like how the sourdough was t too thick overall i was very happy with the food and service bringing family back so we can do the grazing plate also live how a staff member brought out a bowl of water for a dog who was sitting patiently while his owner ate happy to recommend and visit again as plenty on the menu to try,finally get rhursday morning breakfast course order eggs benedict crispy bacon carrot ginger fresh press juice long black coffee friend egg benedict salmon caramel latte service quick friendly juice tasty personally would live ginger personal preference coffee love strong coffee usually ask extra shot pleasant friend say latte good egg benedict tasty generous serf egg cook perfectly bacon come crispy ask generous serve salmon like sourdough t thick overall happy food service bring family back graze plate also live staff member bring bowl water dog sit patiently owner ate happy recommend visit plenty menu try
"I went here for breakfast this morning and was so pleasantly surprised. They were n't allowing dine in so I got pancakes to take away. for two HUGE pancakes. With berries and maple syrup for 50c. Not bad at all. The only problem was that they were slightly undercooked, kind of spongey, which i fully believed was due to the rush, but they tasted AMAZING. The berries were fresh and delicious. I also bought a coffee, kind of expensive coffee, but that's likely where they get most of their income as it's a coffee place, so completely understandable. Quite possibly the best cappuccino I've ever had. Will one hundred percent return.

"I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. 1. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. 2. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. 3. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes. The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions were notably small, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent. Overall, while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant, the food quality, particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes, did not meet expectations. The pricing, coupled with the small portions, further detracted from the overall dining experience. I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers.",0,i recently visited butter factory and unfortunately my experience was quite disappointing especially with regards to the korean chicken and lemon squid dishes korean chicken the korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors i was expecting the seasoning was bland and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as i had hoped for it seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature korean chicken taste lemon squid the lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations the squid was overcooked resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy additionally the lemon sauce lacked balance being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out pricing and portions one of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at butter factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes the dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served the portions were notably small leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent overall while the ambiance of butter factory was pleasant the food quality particularly the korean chicken and lemon squid dishes did not meet expectations the pricing coupled with the small portions further detracted from the overall dining experience i hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers,recently visit butter factory unfortunately experience quite disappointing especially regards korean chicken lemon squid dish korean chicken korean chicken dish lack authentic flavor expect season bland texture chicken not crispy hop seem like either undercooked not prepared proper technique achieve signature korean chicken taste lemon squid lemon squid dish also fell short expectation squid overcook result rubbery texture difficult enjoy additionally lemon sauce lack balance overly sour without complementary flavor round price portion one significant drawback experience butter factory pricing combine portion size dish quite expensive consider quality quantity food serve portion notably small leave feel unsatisfied not get good value money spend overall ambiance butter factory pleasant food quality particularly korean chicken lemon squid dish not meet expectation price couple small portion detract overall dining experience hope restaurant take criticism account improve offering provide satisfy din experience customer

"Not a pleasant visit which was disappointing. I stopped here for a break in a long journey, having been on the road 4 hours already. When I was served, I ordered a coffee and was bluntly told they did n’t accept dirty keep cups( I had made a coffee at home when leaving). I understand it is not ideal having a dirty cup, but the way it was handled, in a rude, blunt tone was not good customer service. I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion.",0,not a pleasant visit which was disappointing i stopped here for a break in a long journey having been on the road hours already when i was served i ordered a coffee and was bluntly told they did n t accept dirty keep cups i had made a coffee at home when leaving i understand it is not ideal having a dirty cup but the way it was handled in a rude blunt tone was not good customer service i almost just walked out right then and there which i wish i had done but i was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll the food was delicious however the roll was small firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set as soon as i bit down into it yolk spurted out and ran everywhere not ideal i know that hospitality is struggling at the moment and if i was in bendigo i would give this place another go just to give it another chance clearly it is a well loved local haunt my experience however was underwhelming good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot and there was not a lot of it on this occasion,not pleasant visit disappointing stop break long journey road hour already serve ordered coffee bluntly tell n t accept dirty keep cup make coffee home leave understand not ideal dirty cup way handle rude blunt tone not good customer service almost walk right wish do tight schedule order bacon egg roll food delicious however roll small firm quite high egg cook white set soon bite yolk spurt ran everywhere not ideal know hospitality struggle moment bendigo would give place another go give another chance clearly well loved local haunt experience however underwhelming good customer service cause forgive lot not lot occasion

"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding.",1,my brother took me here for lunch which was nice of him our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was it took men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope once inside the waitress seated us at our table which was in the middle of the room this would n t be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant aside from some rando in shorts at the bar who left soon after the decor is nice the waitress served our table water took our orders then went and made our drinks the food seemed to take a while which i thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve us i guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever no complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came top tier served and presented well and tasted better than it looked about the best a bundy bogan can ask for the waitress serving us the only waitress there also made our cocktails she took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered which as somewhat of a mixologist myself i could appreciate overall i had a pleasant dining experience and i would definitely come here again on someone else money between entrees mains and drinks we racked up although we were given back in change for some unknown reason it was really mysterious another mystery was what was upstairs they had chairs parked in front so you could n t easily get up there but i think next time i will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding,brother take lunch nice first impression heavy slide entry door take men small goat tow open rope inside waitress seat u table middle room would n t unusual except two customer restaurant aside rando short bar leave soon decor nice waitress serve table water take order go make drink food seem take thought odd consider number people serve u guess kitchen staff catch whatever kardashians whatever no complaint food drink finally come top tier serve present well taste well looked best bundy bogan ask waitress serve u waitress also make cocktail take pride craft unique house special offer somewhat mixologist could appreciate overall pleasant dining experience would definitely come someone else money entree mains drink rack although give back change unknown reason really mysterious another mystery upstairs chair park front could n t easily get think next time try sneak uncover whatever secret hide

"Delicious food. Top service. Lovely environment. Only complaints were 1. the samosa I had as a starter was EXTREMELY hot( not as in spicy, as in fresh out of the fryer). It initially burnt my tongue. I needed to cut it up and let the steam out for a few minutes. 2. The waitress, although great, was a little difficult for me to hear because she spoke very softly. Still, these are very minor criticisms. I'm being a bit nit-picky.

"When my mother and I walked in, the bar staff just stared at us. No greeting, no smile, just stared. It made us feel like we should have walked out in embarrassment. We were there to eat. No direction from bar staff, we just stumbled upon the menu while being stared at from the bar. We then just wondered around before discovering where to order, by the same staff member that stared at us. The tables were grotty and old and the seats had more stains on them than a 20 year old chair. I then went to order drinks, big mistake. Female staff member stared at me again while they tendered to another customer. I waited over 5 minutes after being stared at. At about minute 4, some guy walked in and sat at the bar. How rude I was to think I was to be served first. Shame on me. I was passively aggressively ignored until their needs were met and then finally served at a sloths pace. Bar staff did n't care at all. The chefs special laksa for 31 was so bland, I could n't finish but half of it. The BLAT burger was the only save. We wo n't be back.",0,when my mother and i walked in the bar staff just stared at us no greeting no smile just stared it made us feel like we should have walked out in embarrassment we were there to eat no direction from bar staff we just stumbled upon the menu while being stared at from the bar we then just wondered around before discovering where to order by the same staff member that stared at us the tables were grotty and old and the seats had more stains on them than a year old chair i then went to order drinks big mistake female staff member stared at me again while they tendered to another customer i waited over minutes after being stared at at about minute some guy walked in and sat at the bar how rude i was to think i was to be served first shame on me i was passively aggressively ignored until their needs were met and then finally served at a sloths pace bar staff did n t care at all the chefs special laksa for was so bland i could n t finish but half of it the blat burger was the only save we wo n t be back,mother walk bar staff star u no greet no smile star make u feel like walked embarrassment eat no direction bar staff stumble upon menu star bar wonder around discover order staff member star u table grotty old seat stain year old chair go order drink big mistake female staff member star tender another customer wait minute star minute guy walk sat bar rude think serve first shame passively aggressively ignore need meet finally serve sloths pace bar staff n t care chef special laksa bland could n t finish half blat burger save wo n t back

"The Press Shop was our first stop for brunch during our day trip to Bowral. Arriving at AM on a Sunday, we were surprised to find a line, but our friends quickly secured a table for our group. A server promptly approached us to take our drink orders while we reviewed the menu. After a few minutes, we chose our dishes and flagged down the same waiter. Despite ordering our food soon after our drinks, there was a noticeable delay, and we nearly finished our drinks before the food arrived.

THE worst McDonalds we have ever been to anywhere in the world. The place was filthy. It was not busy either but the staff were all standing and joking paying no attention to customers or bothering to clear up. The order of 2 ice creams and a frozen drink took 10 mins. Although we had paid for a large drink it was half full. It took over 5 minutes for my wife to be served despite several members of staff looking at her. The attitude was then poor. The baked that is supposed to the lost the manager and supervisor was empty. It clear there is absolutely no leadership here and no are as to whether a customer gets a decent service.

"EDIT: I came here again soon after and it was so much better! I think it might have been that I left the noodles sealed in the bowl for too long before eating so they went a bit mushy. I highly recommend removing the lid as soon as you can.

"With a reputation for great food and terrific views, I was very excited to finally get to Cafe Catalina. Despite paying for parking and finding a closed carpark separating the Cafe from the waterfront, I entered with high hopes. I was surprised that the best part of the Cafe was n't in use, putting customers together in their large dining area. After a bit of a wait, finally got to order drinks, a bit of a wait again to order food. Not usually one to go the full 3 courses, since we were celebrating we lashed out. Overall, I think they levelled up with each course. Particularly loved the pasta, the dumplings were also really special. Although not my go to for deserts, the mousse was brilliant!

"A beautifully styled space with the fun of a sushi train offering a continuous stream of sushi and other dishes. We had takeaway, which was quite nice. The staff member who served me was polite and friendly, though a little too optimistic about the wait time. The overall experience could have been improved by more careful attention to detail in the sushi work( neatness and precision), and consideration to the packaging( paper bags in a plastic carry bag made for some slightly squashed sushi rolls). Also, the layout of the shop entrance is awkward as the open door blocks the takeaway counter, requiring lots of polite shuffling of people whenever a customer enters.

"If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, look no further than Starfish. Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight.

"Well priced & very tasty. We had the calamari & chips, fish & chips, onion rings & the mediterranean salad. The calamari were big & perfectly cooked, the chips were crunchy & the home made onions rings were the best I've ever had. The salad was OK, but a bit of a let down in quality compared the cooked food. Overall though it was very enjoyable & well priced. Basic tables & chairs available inside & on the footpath.

"Good place for a cheaper meal especially if you join as a member. Make sure you know where to find it first. Its now called the Chill N Talk cafe and located within the Coffs Village complex. Easier to find then park. You need to ho into the village located behind the Coles Supermarket on Harbour Drive. Do n't expect to find a park do why not park in Coles underground car park. The Cafe is right around the back. It has both indoor and outdoor seating and often hosts groups such as The Coffs Harbour & District Motorcycle Restorers Club Good range of coffee, teas, juice, milkshakes and small eats like lime & lemon cheesecake, carrot cake, scones etc. They also serve meals which are freshly prepared.

"I ordered in this shop multiple times in the past mostly pickup orders. In the past I never had any issues, the food is delicious.

I made a complaint through the app and also called the shop. There was a lady who said she was the manager first but she was nice. She asked me to send the pics and I did. The next time I called another man picked up and he said he was the manager. He said this is the standard that they always offer and that he had a look at the camera and the pic I sent and he said that the correct portion!! I did mention that never been this less before and he simply would n’t acknowledge it or offer any alternative solution.

"Positives: First time going to this place today. Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n’t tolerate a little spice the sauce is n’t for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n’t finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n’t big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n’t eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n’t really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:)",1,positives first time going to this place today let me tell you coming from a family of chefs this was delectable the dine in meals came out fast they were large portions and very good temperature we ordered the flowered onion fried and whole we ordered the louisiana chook both entrees then i had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg the mash and veg was perfectly cooked though the mash tastes a little like packet mash the sauce with the louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n t tolerate a little spice the sauce is n t for you but man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible was thoroughly enjoyable the parmigiana was large so much so i could n t finish it all great that they gave takeaways negatives the drink i ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section tasted great only issue i really had was the lemon seeds in the drink lucky the straws were n t big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink we loved the louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in specifically regarding our dining experience we also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu the churros are exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it but the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite the sauce also tasted store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking the flowered onion leaves much to be desired for i definitely would n t eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up the sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal other i must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay just did n t really get time to savour the entrees the serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating also incase anyone wants to know they have the mccs discounts for marines over all my dining experience was fantastic just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes and the wait for takeaway was much longer than the wait for the main meal taste for those specific meals besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar was great will definitely bring my husband and other family here again,positive first time go place today let tell come family chef delectable dine meal come fast large portion good temperature order flowered onion fry whole ordered louisiana chook entrees parmigiana main mash veg mash veg perfectly cook though mash taste little like packet mash sauce louisiana chicken little spicy ca n t tolerate little spice sauce n t man oh man crunch chook juicy chicken incredible thoroughly enjoyable parmigiana large much could n t finish great give takeaway negative drink order summer one mocktails section taste great issue really lemon seed drink lucky straw n t big enough suck otherwise would issue try fish multiple seed drink love louisiana chicken much order take away sadly disappointment portion size different much small not crunchy still tasty juicy not portion size dine specifically regard din experience also order take away chocolate churro fruit fondu churros exquisite far crunch go little no cinnamon sugar lack cinnamon sugar cover chocolate sauce fruit eat together bite bite sauce also taste store buy still taste good may not everyone like flower onion leave much desire definitely would n t eat essentially whole onion fry sauce nice go well main meal must say brought main not long get entree okay n t really get time savour entree serf seem little place generally welcome accomodating also incase anyone want know mccs discount marine din experience fantastic little disappointed takeaway serve size wait takeaway much longer wait main meal taste specific meal besides onion lack cinnamon sugar great definitely bring husband family

The server then came to tell us the lasagna and lamb ragu were actually unavailable, not great to hear after we had already paid. So we both ordered the Bolognese. The Bolognese tasted like Heinz tinned spaghetti, definitely not restaurant quality. The terrible quality of the Hawaiian pizza speaks for itself, see the images.

I even asked for confirmation if it was usually that size( they said it was but I literally seen them bigger yesterday). Disappointing really. The staff on today were n’t exactly rude, but they were n’t that friendly either. It felt like they just wanted me out asap. While I do understand that it hard working Sunday afternoons, I also just did n’t feel that great being served. That being said, I seen more than a couple really lovely staff and I always hope to see them around when I visit, but I just thought I voice my experience today …",0,usually my experience at this hj is great and some of the staff are really lovely but todays experience is questionable at best i was looking forward to getting the biscoff storm as a birthday treat but honestly i feel ripped off with how much they actually give you i even asked for confirmation if it was usually that size they said it was but i literally seen them bigger yesterday disappointing really the staff on today were n t exactly rude but they were n t that friendly either it felt like they just wanted me out as soon as possible while i do understand that it hard working sunday afternoons i also just did n t feel that great being served that being said i seen more than a couple really lovely staff and i always hope to see them around when i visit but i just thought i voice my experience today,usually experience hj great staff really lovely today experience questionable best look forward get biscoff storm birthday treat honestly feel ripped much actually give even ask confirmation usually size say literally see big yesterday disappoint really staff today n t exactly rude n t friendly either felt like want soon possible understand hard work sunday afternoon also n t feel great serve say see couple really lovely staff always hope see around visit thought voice experience today

"Second time ordering from this place. I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service / delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n’t a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n’t make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n’t want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough. Wo nt be back as there are other places more generous with the serving.

This place used to do amazing Afghan naan. But now the quality and weight of naan has dropped. Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,0,this place used to do amazing afghan naan but now the quality and weight of naan has dropped naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns this business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan one line of one pack and another line for more than one pack which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line they need to adopt a number serving system soon i think lot of fighting happening there during weekends hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,place use amaze afghan naan quality weight naan drop naan get small middle naan like paper burn business not operate ethical way since two line naan one line one pack another line one pack ridiculous co line one pack get stagnant one pack line move since serve line need adopt number serve system soon think lot fight happen weekend hope owner think good way soon council police intervenes pack naan

We had a couple of jumbo pizzas, salad and chips which was plenty for the 5 of us. Good that they do half half pizzas too so we could try a wider range. Kids had Margherita and Hawaiian, adults had a couple of the veggie pizza toppings. Thin and crispy style with not too much toppings and cheese, which is how we prefer our pizzas.

"An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese-style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients, no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over 45yrs. Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho.

"This is one of the many restaurants spruiking for business along popular Hardware Lane with great character and ambience. We were enthusiastically greeted and seated on a busy Saturday afternoon. The menu had all the expected Italian favourites, and pizzas looked to be the most popular choice. We tried a pizza and risotto dish, both of which were very enjoyable. It was very busy and looked popular with both tourists and locals. We decided to try the desserts because everyone wants to know if the tiramisu is any good, right ? Well, it was good, as was the gooey lava cake. All said, an enjoyable meal.",1,this is one of the many restaurants spruiking for business along popular hardware lane with great character and ambience we were enthusiastically greeted and seated on a busy saturday afternoon the menu had all the expected italian favourites and pizzas looked to be the most popular choice we tried a pizza and risotto dish both of which were very enjoyable it was very busy and looked popular with both tourists and locals we decided to try the desserts because everyone wants to know if the tiramisu is any good right well it was good as was the gooey lava cake all said an enjoyable meal,one many restaurant spruiking business along popular hardware lane great character ambience enthusiastically greet seat busy saturday afternoon menu expect italian favourite pizzas look popular choice try pizza risotto dish enjoyable busy look popular tourist local decide try dessert everyone want know tiramisu good right well good gooey lava cake say enjoyable meal

"Spent some time at the Rockhampton Museum of art. Overall this museum had some lovely peices, although i did not agree with some of there are telling people who were born in a coutry to leave, but art is art. I would recommend, but not for everyone, kid sensative material, racial material and sexualised material could trigger the weak. There is some beautiful peices and should be worth a look.",1,spent some time at the rockhampton museum of art overall this museum had some lovely peices although i did not agree with some of there are telling people who were born in a coutry to leave but art is art i would recommend but not for everyone kid sensative material racial material and sexualised material could trigger the weak there is some beautiful peices and should be worth a look,spent time rockhampton museum art overall museum lovely peices although not agree tell people born coutry leave art art would recommend not everyone kid sensative material racial material sexualise material could trigger weak beautiful peices worth look
