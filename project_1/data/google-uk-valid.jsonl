The server did not understand the menu and gave us wrong information regarding vegetarian options multiple times. We were then given a vegetarian menu and upon ordering, we were told the menu was out of date and the options had changed \/ were unavailable. The afternoon tea was also below the usual standard as the sandwiches were dry \/ stale and the chocolate dessert was topped with canned whipped cream, followed by a whole pot of watery chocolate sauce. The other cakes were also underwhelming and it was no surprise the table next to us left their cakes uneaten. Very disappointing experience.","sentiment_label":0}

Ordered lamb Haneed, One portion with rice, but if one person is eating they charge 15, if two persons are eating they charge 19 for the same quantity of food, reason, I do n\u2019t know. 3. I did n\u2019t get the free banana, other tables where Africans were eating, they gave banana, not to us. Sad. 4. I was with family, so sat in family area which was alright \u2026 but it was noisy in the restaurant. 5. Chili sauce, was very very very hot, did n\u2019t like it \u2026 but lemon soup was fantastic and soooper yummy. 6.

The 2 staff that was on were nice friendly and happy to help with questions so 5 stars with service. Used a coupon for a free garlic bread which was pretty small so we got a small bit each but was average taste but free so ca n't complain on that. Drinks. Cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe. Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7. I would visit again but with not such a big group due to costs but we still enjoyed the evening and enjoyable just not fantastic. I m no food critic just an honest reviewer:)","sentiment_label":1}

The cafe now closed( so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond.

It a must-try for anyone visiting the restaurant. Another highlight is the Chatti Chor, a rich and aromatic biryani cooked in a traditional clay pot, which seals in all the flavors and spices, resulting in a dish that both comforting and exotic.

The organisation and service was excellent and ca n't be faulted at all, fantastic staff all round. Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20).

The news of running out of whole chicken extended our wait to 30-40 minutes. Hoping to salvage the evening, we ordered chicken livers as a starter, priced at a hefty 9. To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness.

During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional. From the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality, it's clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences.

When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances. For example, I'm lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options.

{"id":1.142059093e+20,"text":"First time visit today-we will be coming back. The first waitress was quick to seat us with menus, which are pretty extensive. The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite. Although parking is a bit of an issue, particularly for those who are less able, we are looking forward to coming back again, and will likely recommend it.","sentiment_label":1}

The chicken in the korma was on the bone and pink in the middle so could n't be eaten. I've given a 2 star as the prawn curry was nice and flavours in the sauce were fab. Lots of oil floating on top though. Ca n't pay by card in the restaurant which seems unusual in this day and age and also a pain because of having to walk to cash machine!

We had just arrived, and as we were taking our coats off, she asked if we were ready to order. She then came again, not two minutes after that, and asked once again. By the third time, when we hurried to choose so as to not be pressured again, she quickly responded \" Thank God \" when we said we were ready. She then proceeded to ask us to leave, when she saw we had finished our food, but I guess she must not have noticed we still had our drinks. I would still go back!

{"id":1.096151589e+20,"text":"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.","sentiment_label":1}

Because neither of them( 3) bothered to come to our table for 15 mins to ask if we need anything and the place was n't busy at all by that time. They looked at me with a surprise. Food ? You did n't order food. Indeed I did. The lady from bar turned up after serving a customer. She apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food. She offered our food on the house at this point. She kept on apologizing. She was an excellent employee and 5 * customer service from her! The waitresses still did n't bother.
