Now coming to the service, the buffet breakfast is really small with about 4 items and although they claim that it starts at 7, you can not get anything before and at times even before 8! The bar is kinda not up to the standards of a family restaurant. It gives off a seedy vibe which makes it not a good place to be with one family. While the Indian food served in this place is quite delectable the Chinese food is a real horror! There's no swimming pool. Also if you want to hang out your wet clothes from a trip to the beach they do not offer a place for that. You have to go for their highly expensive laundry service instead.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well.

Adequate quantity was there. tasty food. The chicken pieces in noodles were delicious. price was very reasonable. X Food was tasty but felt a little bit extra spicy. Spicy amount should be less as not everyone is comfortable with it. X As I asked for sause, they gave very less amount of sause in a small glass. Should have given a ketchup \/ sauce bottle. X waiting time was a lot. Felt like they preferred to make food for the online deliveries first, then they gave us. Take the negative points as feedback Overall I loved the place!","sentiment_label":0}
