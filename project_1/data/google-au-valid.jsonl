Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":1.171742907e+20,"text":"Positives: First time going to this place today. Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n\u2019t tolerate a little spice the sauce is n\u2019t for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n\u2019t finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n\u2019t big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n\u2019t eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n\u2019t really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great.

My partner ordered the steak medium rare and got a steak well done... in a steak restaurant you expect that the cooking levels should n't be a problem and that they know their way around. He had to give the meat back and I had to eat it once because otherwise it got cold. Great to celebrate a birthday in the restaurant and I ca n't even eat with my partner at the same time. Then his food arrived( when I had almost finished eating) and the meat was only cooked medium. absolute disappointment Dessert: when we got the dessert menu we had to wait over 20 minutes to be able to order. We then got fed up and got up and paid without ordering dessert. We've been to various steak restaurants all over the world, but we definitely would n't go to this one again. The food was ok, but there is definitely better!","sentiment_label":0}
{"id":1.030760169e+20,"text":"I really wanted this to be good because it's local, but was thoroughly disappointed. We ordered the family deal which is 85, added 2 X can of coke, the meal jumped to 97! 6 for a can of coke is outrageous. We paid and sat down to wait. The server then came to tell us the lasagna and lamb ragu were actually unavailable, not great to hear after we had already paid. So we both ordered the Bolognese. The Bolognese tasted like Heinz tinned spaghetti, definitely not restaurant quality. The terrible quality of the Hawaiian pizza speaks for itself, see the images. It did n't taste great, we did n't finish it. I gave 2 stars because the pizza al aglio was pretty good. All in all, would n't go back.","sentiment_label":0}

I was looking forward to getting the biscoff storm as a birthday treat but honestly I feel ripped off with how much they actually give you. I even asked for confirmation if it was usually that size( they said it was but I literally seen them bigger yesterday). Disappointing really. The staff on today were n\u2019t exactly rude, but they were n\u2019t that friendly either. It felt like they just wanted me out asap. While I do understand that it hard working Sunday afternoons, I also just did n\u2019t feel that great being served. That being said, I seen more than a couple really lovely staff and I always hope to see them around when I visit, but I just thought I voice my experience today \u2026","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":1.156420184e+20,"text":"Second time ordering from this place. I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service \/ delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n\u2019t a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n\u2019t make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n\u2019t want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast \/ thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough. Wo nt be back as there are other places more generous with the serving. All the best.","sentiment_label":0}

This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan","sentiment_label":0}

Finally had a shrimp roll. It was pretty good, but had a bit too much mayo for my tastes. This is just a preference thing. I'd be excited to try this place again!","sentiment_label":1}

Kids had Margherita and Hawaiian, adults had a couple of the veggie pizza toppings. Thin and crispy style with not too much toppings and cheese, which is how we prefer our pizzas.

{"id":1.059394189e+20,"text":"An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese-style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients, no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over 45yrs. Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho. Definitely order one per bowl.. it's not a sharing serving size at all!","sentiment_label":1}
