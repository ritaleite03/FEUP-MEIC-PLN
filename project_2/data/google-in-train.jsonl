The fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of KFC, which is quite an accomplishment. The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it. I hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future.","sentiment_label":0}

The ambience is good just one problem I felt the behaviour of the waiter was a bit rude and in attitude not sure why, maybe because we were not Marathi. He was literally dropping the plates and dishes on the table as if he was doing a favour by serving the food. Also not sure why they were closing the hotel around 3-4pm, it was Sunday afternoon. Not sure why they would close it in daytime.","sentiment_label":1}

I must say they did a good job on making it quite similar to Kolkata biryani. But they can make it better of course. The quantity was really good. But the quality of chicken was less. And the chicken was also little dry. They can improve in this. And of course the price is very high. In Kolkata we get double portion in half the price. So yeah that's from my side.

{"id":1.169726069e+20,"text":"A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises. I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.","sentiment_label":1}

It was very fresh. MUST TRY DISH. Pichi potta kooli fry-if your a lover of spicy food go for it. It was prepared with good amount of pepper. Eat this dish you we get your mouth hot. It tasted to next level with rasam & curd rice. Mutton Biriyani-Heavenly food. No other words. Non-veg meals-it was not to our expectations when compared to Chennai meals. It had two varieties of non-veg curry but for us it was like veg curry no flavour of non-veg. It comes with a boiled egg & unlimited meals. But they claim this is there speciality meal. If you plan for meal, my suggestion is go for veg meals & order non veg side dish. One more think, the salt was less in most of the dishes so add it for your taste to enjoy it. The hotel is just on the bye-pass before you reach Salem & before the Salem famous Selvi mess. It has ample parking area with a friendly elderly person to assist you in parking.

We initially tried to order Hyderabadi Biryani, only to be told it was n't available, which was puzzling for a dinner item during dinner hours. We settled for the Chilli Paneer-Fried Rice combo and cold coffee, which set us back 357 rupees, an amount that seemed excessive given the meager portions we received. Unfortunately, when our order arrived, it felt like they had reheated a frozen dish in the oven for five minutes, as the fried rice lacked freshness.

{"id":1.078105921e+20,"text":"This was once a best theatre around this region, But right now it is not upto the mark. It badly needs renovation. I have been visiting this theatre since childhood and it was good until 5 years back. After then there were lots of things that felt like should be improved. The sound quality is really poor and inside the theatre and there are literally spiderwebs on the walls. There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian. This theatre really has scope to get improved, but has not made any improvements recently. The snacks inside this theatre is not that much great. You get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips, popcorn and egg puffs. When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience). The Air conditioning system is really good in this theatre. If someone from the theatre management sees this review, kindly take them into consideration and please make improvements. Thanks!","sentiment_label":0}

The Chilli Garlic Fried Rice was decent, but the Oriental Chicken dish was unexpectedly spicy, making it a bit challenging to enjoy. However, the reason for my 4-star rating lies in the consistent quality of food I've enjoyed in the past at Second Wife. The Kebabs, in particular, have always been a highlight, with their delicious flavors and perfect texture.

Next I tried their special non veg sandwich which I felt satisfactory. Their beverage section was not that updated, they had only milk shake and items like lime soda, mohito etc. which were present in the menu but they were unable to provide. Another drawback I think is their washing area; a small basin is there with a separate jug kept which one needs to pour and wash the hands if required; but that may be due to the lack of space. Overall the ambience was good with AC seating area with a capacity of around 10-15 people max.","sentiment_label":1}

As at Burdwan town itself has 3 or 4 branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream. Actually I do n't like all the items here in which Maine part is mostly different types of cream. The snacks items available here are so so. Can not say the best.

They have an AC dining area in the 1st floor but the AC stays off in the \" winter \"( like every other shop with AC in town) and the windows also stay closed.

Ambience is good no doubt. 1) The Turkish lamb soup was nice. 2) The hummus with chicken was also nice, tandoori roti was a little dry though but I ca n't complain. 3) Chicken Cheese Fatayer is good. 4) Chicken Ankara Tandoori was nice but had better tandoori than this. 5) Chicken Mandi rice was okay. Plus 1 Bisleri and Sprite for the above entire menu we paid which I think was little on the higher side. Did not expect this much, anyways actually the amount is high because the quantity is limited. The staff was very courteous and polite they were not properly trained but there attitude towards there guest was commendable. One table besides us ordered fish and than the couple complained that it was bland and no taste, the staff said in Turkish cuisine this is the taste but the couple did not agree. Although I feel the hotel was right they gave them a completely new chicken dish and took the fish back. So there attitude is right, the management must he having this attitude hence the employees carry it, trickle down effect. Overall Food is good Quantity is less Ambience is nice Price is high But The attitude is just right. BTW, they have a thaal at sufficient for 4 person, did not try that but now I feel that would have been nice. Try that people for me. Take care, And Eat well.","sentiment_label":1}

Chicken lollipops are worst. I got leftover food delivered to me which I ordered through swiggy, chicken was hard to chew and dry. Also, have tasted nalli gosh biryani which is awesome in taste. I can see that the quality is decreasing over the time. We have ordered: mutton hot & sour soup( Rs 145), tandoori half plate( Rs 250), mutton dum biryani( Rs 350). 1. Mutton soup was a bit spicy. Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3. Mutton dum biryani, mouth watering, biryani is soo good and mutton was perfectly cooked and juicy. Must try items: tandoori and mutton dum biryani.

Firstly, it's crazy to witness the other female staff arguing with the male staff( who seems to be the head of the same group of workers). Keeping their argument aside, I am overwhelmed to see how the male staff handled the situation, with complete patience( although he struck the table out loud once). It's normal to argue with a coworker, right ?! We all do once in a while but choose the location wisely. To be honest, I'm completely unsure of what was going on since I do not speak Assamese. Secondly, y' all know that the temperature in this region is hot. I was expecting the AC to be turned on while customers are served but that did n't happen here( could be a technical problem but I did n't insist). I hope they value their customer more. To wrap this up, I'm happy with the delicious chicken wings and expect more value for a customer especially when they dine in despite many circumstances that could be avoided.","sentiment_label":1}

The special touch in their tikka and the exquisite texture of the khasta are testament to the mastery honed over years of perfecting their craft. Additionally, their dosa adds another dimension to their menu, showcasing their versatility in offering diverse yet equally delightful options.

Somedays before in Instagram I saw the new branch of this Shop in kannur, but I was not sure that all items will be available or not. So I took phone number from Google and made call but it connected to Thalassery branch. Even I made call to enquire about kannur branch they were very customer friendly and clarify my all enquiries. So we decided to go. We reached there by 0900pm in the night, shop opens till 10 in the night. In ground floor only cakes are available, there are a variety of cakes in different flavours. Dine-in were arranged in the first floor. Staircase is very steep, i do n't prefer old people to visit here coz no seating is arranged in the ground floor. Interior were very welcoming. Table was nicely arrange to sit 4 or 5 person. We ordered Eiffel tower and Jabulani delight. Both costs _ each. Eiffel tower is the combination of cakes and Icecreams. First 3 layer is icecreams and other are cakes. At top of the tower there is a ferroro Rocher placed. Presentation of both were amazing and mesmerizing one. Jabulani delight is also a mixture of cakes and Icecreams. It's loaded with nuts and dryfruits. One thing I suggest everyone is please order this 2 item if you are of groups of four and above else you people will be trapped, because it's such a huge one comparatively.","sentiment_label":1}

When we think of Kashmir, the first thing we visualise is the beautiful Shikaras in Dal Lake, the exquisite Mughal Gardens, the cascading Shrunz and Aharbal waterfalls, the magical Betaab valley, the stunning Sonamarg and the glorious Gulmarg. True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir. Chattabal of Chitergul-Shangus area is just 32 km from district Anantnag and merely 20 km away from the famous Mughal Garden of Achabal, situated in the lap of Pir Panjal mountains. Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature. The vast green plains look like natural tapestries, as if spread by divine hands. It has two routes through which people can reach the place: one is from Shangus road, and the second is from KP Kehribal.","sentiment_label":1}

The beef roll is a bit small, the beef is chewy and the roll or paratha is tough. It tastes less than expected for 60 rupees. A bit oily, too much oil for my taste. It also lacks taste and you can taste the burnt paratha as well. Plain rice taste like plain rice, not too bad and not great. Chilli smells bad and just plain hot without any flavour Customer service is bad without much thought for the customer at all. They're extremely loud and the waiting time was long.

Garlic Prawns was also nice.... Big size of prawns and lil touch of garlic. Phuket fish was nice too.. subtle taste and soft fish. # Maincourse Mutton Double Gosht Biryani was outstanding, Chicken 65 and one boiled egg on top and super tender mutton pieces stuffed inside fluffy and aromatic long rice grains and those are again decorated with Barista & twig of mint. Appetizing and flavourful biryani after long time... Chicken Punjabi was amaaaazing, hot in red gravy with big chunks of tender chicken. Gravy was flavourful enough and goes best with garlic Naan. # Desserts Qubani Ka Meetha, Double ka meetha and Phirni. My favourite was ofc phirni","sentiment_label":1}

His tenure is often remembered for the administrative reforms and infrastructural development he brought to the region, significantly influencing the city layout and public administration system. The statue commemorates his contributions to Bangalore, serving as a bridge between the past and present. Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history.

PPV or Pooja Pure Vegetarian is quite popular with the people and tourists.","sentiment_label":1}
{"id":1.028110261e+20,"text":"Akbar had built several palaces in the Agra Fort, and his son and successor Jahangir had added to them. These comprise the Jahangiri Mahal and Akbari Mahal, both approached through a beautiful gate decorated with red sandstone and yellow dholpur stone. The palaces inside are small, made almost completely of red sandstone, very intricately carved, and with some traces of beautiful painted and incised plaster. The Agra Fort ticket, Rs 35 per Indian adult, covers these palaces. An interesting artefact just outside the gate here is Jahangir bath tub, shaped like a giant tea cup with rough steps on the side to climb in.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":1.096487979e+20,"text":"On the travel from Trissur to Calicut, because of the road work happening, it had become very difficult to find a good stop for a coffee. We were a little irritated but again dint want to spoil our mood for a dinner. Calicut is know for its different varieties of food served, halwa, juices, and snacks. We stopped near Dakshin, which when enquired with friends, many of them suggested the place. We had to wait for some empty seats, self service it was, making the order took some time, then waiting at the counter for the food also took sometime. The food was ok there, I thought the hype was a little more for that place. Porotta were good, kerala porotta( how can it be bad). It was served with channa masala, and then dosa and tea to end dinner. I would search for better places here and I am sure there will be many more in Calicut.","sentiment_label":1}
