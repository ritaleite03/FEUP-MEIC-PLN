{"id":"1d5o3mj","text":"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   \nMy mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.","sentiment_label":0}

OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn\u2019t reflect reality at all. \n\nQuite a few schools pooled the meals vouchers and bought in bulk to make up food packages, so that parents got more stuff than they would have got individually. \n\nPersonally I think it\u2019s disgraceful that schools are practically the only safety net that kids have regarding nutrition, domestic violence and mental health.","sentiment_label":0}
