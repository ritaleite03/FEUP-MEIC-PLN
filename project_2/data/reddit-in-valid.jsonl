There is a very slim chance for kids to get into iit and nits and govt medical colleges which are shit compared to the ones in us except a few like aiims even with a alot of hard work. Even a non Ivy League college there is miles better than top nits and govt medical colleges for technical education and medical studies. \n\nThe biggest factor is ease of getting into us colleges as compared to indian ones due to population. \n\nIf she wants to get into pure sciences the situation is even worse. A bachelor in science in top colleges like delhi university amounts to shit(telling from experience) compared to us. \n\nAnd lastly high school. I have some friends who did their high schooling in the us. They can vouch that the quality of high school life there is a lot better. In India hardly anyone comes to school in 11th and 12th standards in science stream as all are going coaching for competitive exams for most part of the day. It breaks kids. A lot of them end up losing friends  and feel alone.\n\n26 kids kiled themselves in kota(coaching hub) last year. \nIn 2024 7 kids have already kiled themselves. \n\nIndia is no place for kids to enjoy their life and education if you have better choices like the us. \n\nWith the amount of savings and property that you have your daughter can have a good education and life there. \nPlease don't ruin it by coming to India.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d4yqpb","text":"I think you are confusing an Israeli based \"private\" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves. The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.\n\nIsrael has several \"private\" companies offering targeted services for\/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies\/clients.\n\nPegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.\n\nThese \"private\" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel\/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.\n\nThis was just an irrelevant event for Isreali govt to care or interfere with, I think.","sentiment_label":0}
