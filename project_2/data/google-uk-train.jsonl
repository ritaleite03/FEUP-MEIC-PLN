The burgers were nice, nothing bad to say about it; the chilly hot dog was very nice, I do recommend it and the girls there were lovely. The cons: the kids' milkshake bottle was more than half with foam, the cooler drink was more ice than actual juices advertised-which after a few sips became almost tasteless, very small portion of fries for the price very little toppings, mac and cheese was no cheese sauce. All in all, we felt \" robbed \" of our food and drinks. The high bill did not reflect what was actually ordered... \u00bf \u00bf \u00bf And at last, it is not a kid friendly place, especially for kids with high energy levels, nothing is provided to keep them occupied.

{"id":1.094921854e+20,"text":"On the face, a tired 1920s hotel with splendid views of Brighton seafront. With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n\u2019t like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n\u2019t underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms. If you looking for the wow factor, do n\u2019t stay here. If you looking a nice attentive hotel experience where you are looked after and get a good night sleep, this may be the place for you. Would I come back ? Yes!","sentiment_label":1}

Lord is my witness, we ordered, washed my hands without using the toilet I should point out, returned and food was served. Granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse. The incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all I met with. I politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly \/ remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said \u2018 just you can have refund \u2019. Eventually they remade the food, which unsurprisingly took 3-4x longer to make and was actually cooked through. I never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain. Issues with food are understandable, but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different, and furthermore, to degrade them, and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube, not stringy white chicken, and is uncooked, followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n\u2019t know your managers name when politely asked whom I can address my concerns to given the food was shocking.","sentiment_label":0}

This time, however, one main from our order was completely forgotten and then when reminded( 10 minutes after the other 2 dishes had come out), the wrong burger was delivered and so everyone else had finished and needed to leave before I got my food! At the point of ordering there was also a few things not available, but with no signage \/ notes to let people know. The table gives you a QR code to order food \/ drink from, however after selecting everything and attempting to check out, it flags an error. This happened for all 3 of us.

Burn of the pot taste! Mean ole auntie ca n't cook The plantains were just allright, still no flavour though. Only saving grace was the price which is fair for the portions. Hence 2 stars and not zero. Of course, price is not shown anywhere, they just make it up on the fly and add a few more pounds to the total that they swear is part of the original deal. The 2 consistently ask customers to take off their face masks to order as they claim they ca n't hear through it. Absolute negligence in times of rampant Omicron variant!! I respectfully refused and immediately this one unprofessional main lady throws her hands up at the ceiling, kiss her teeth at me and displays other terribly immature, rude attitude urging her employee to deal with me because of it. Mind you, i caught a cold and did n't want to risk coughing in their faces but i guess that's just me.

This week I used self scan as usual and at the checkout it lost my entire shop. I tried to get the attention of the supervisor but she was chatting as usual so I wheeled my trolley to the kiosk but no one was there. I could have just walked out with my unpaid for shopping. I went back and interrupted the supervisor and told her what had happened. She was dismissive and said it had happened to someone else that morning and the only thing to do was to scan it all again. Bearing in mind it was all neatly packed into bags! Annoying enough but she was n't even remotely apologetic. Just went back to chatting.

{"id":1.006687307e+20,"text":"I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene! I visited with my wife the second time, we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries, which came to. We wo n't be back.","sentiment_label":0}

The staff were friendly and approachable which is always a bonus. The cinema was very clean and spacious, which makes a huge difference. The menue options were good also, we selected a variety of things, popcorn, ice cream, burgers etc We opted for a sofa seat which was perfect for the evening as there was plenty of leg room.

As me and my friend still had our coffee to finish, I said that we would be on our way, as soon as we had finished. This clearly put him and his teams back up, as they headed over to the corner area we were seated and began picking up stools to very heavy handedly dropping them on the tables. The team began to make comments amongst themselves about getting the job done. After a few more mins, we were ready to leave and as we did, I was issued a few very sarcastic have a good evenings by the team. At the bottom of the stairs was the manager, who said they'd just dealt with a technical issue and very confusingly said that was why upstairs was shut, but it was all sorted now. I did mention to him about the rudeness of a few of his staff.

It was also a nostalgia trip, being an avid diner in Studio cafe back in the 90s when a student at the Art College in Hull in my youth. The restaurant has a simple, stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine. It also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff. We were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen. The service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks, but the main course food service was fairly slow. We decided on 2 courses and waited 45 minutes after ordering for our mains, which did seem too long. Desserts arrived much quicker, within 10 minutes The food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food( which seems to be the new bar set for Michelin guide rated food these days... as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society). Portions are generous, and Sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful. A special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion' pudding', which was deemed' the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside. The only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food, as all savoury courses and gravy did seem VERY salty. We would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating. Also, identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff, when ordering or any mention. For example, one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the( enormous) yorkshire pudding, and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free. Which was confirmed. Desserts were excellent, with interesting menu choices, and, again, generous portions. We would return, as the overall experience was enjoyable, but maybe to try the evening menu next time..","sentiment_label":1}

At first, I went in and walked back out after assuming it was shut as there was no staff around, and the whole building was empty with no music, etc. I walked around outside and spoke with a mate who said it should be open and went to try again after 20 minutes. There was a staff on the counter who looked grumpy and not welcoming, but I still ordered my burger meal. Whilst waiting, I could hear some staff at the back being loud and noisy playing about, but I just ignored it, and then they started to play music on their phones. There were no other customers until I left, but the tables were not clean. I sat on one table that was slightly clean to eat when my food was ready thinking this Jesters chunky chicken fillet meal would be great but after a few bites I knew this was a mistake, bland flavour, a few slice of shredded lettuce( nothing else) and literally a pinch of burger sauce.

You do n't always get what you pay for, because sometimes you get that little something special.

{"id":1.11987029e+20,"text":"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019.

It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'. Please note this is not about McDonalds overall; just this specific outlet. I do n't think we'll opt to use it again, but I doubt they care about that anyway.","sentiment_label":0}

It catered to different tastes, making it a great spot for a group with diverse preferences. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5-star rating is that while the drinks and service were excellent, the food menu was a bit limited, and some of the dishes we ordered were just average.

From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken \u2013 tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality. And with the added incentive of a 50 % discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt, there's even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight.","sentiment_label":1}

You can learn a lot from Burger King with properly cooked meals golden arches. Also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature. As with many mainstream burger chains and franchises I find the burgers not served up to 71c cooking temperature. Its always warm and there seems, in the UK no Food and Safety, like the US to require cooking and serving your burger hot at Burger King seriously fix your app. Heck contact me and I'll work with you on it.","sentiment_label":1}

I start with the only positive thing I can remember about this unforgettable experience( for all the wrong reasons), the decor and interior was to a high standard. The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our 27 and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them.","sentiment_label":0}

The service is pretty good, but the food is served very slowly, almost a 20-30 minute wait at lunchtime.

{"id":1.00175456e+20,"text":"I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread, featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri-salted chips and chili cheese bites. The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates. I enthusiastically recommend Amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence.","sentiment_label":1}

Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff \/ service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do!

There was a technical problem that delayed our entrance, resulting in a 40 minute wait but it seemed to go quickly. I could have done without the drop in temperature though. The' show' comprises of projected Christian images onto the walls and ceiling, with a specially composed soundtrack. I actually enjoyed the music as much, or possibly more than the images. It lasted around 15 mins and the room was not over crowded so all had a good view. The imagery felt a bit random despite the theme, and some of it was abstract. I think it would have been more powerful if it had told a story. Strangely I thought the setting was a distraction but that's probably just me. The show was enjoyable and very competitively pricef but I am not sure if it's something that you would see more than once.","sentiment_label":1}

All the food came in no specific order( Mains before Starters, dishes missing components) and even some dishes not arriving at all. The service was not adequate, the waiter spilt an entire glass of some sort of fizzy drink on one of us, and only said \u2018 sorry bro \u2019 and wiped it off with a lack of effort.

We probably would stayed longer( we only stayed just over an hour) and had more food if it was n\u2019t for the rushed feeling.

The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex.

I would suggest asking for a table away from the front door if possible. We had some really lovely food, the menu has are real range of options for every one and some great vegan options. I was really happy with the Vegan Lasagne and the dessert was the highlight. The only downside I would say is that you constantly have Uber eats \/ Delivery Drivers coming through the restaurant that are pushing past you at the table, alongside leaving the door open so when your seated near the front door your constantly getting cold so having to get up to close the door. It definitely ruins the atmosphere when you trying to enjoy your meal.","sentiment_label":1}

Plenty of spaces if you like spacious fine dining. I opted to sit near the escape doors at the back of the venue as the last time I was in the same venue it got pretty ugly, and although this time my visit was during the day, I opted for safety over risk. Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary. The back is quite pleasing on the eye. I can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer. Best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving. Interesting experience nonetheless.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":1.054497027e+20,"text":"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.","sentiment_label":0}

I was very much looking forward to it with the promise of a huge selection of retro games on offer and the kids were keen to try out the vr and ps5 etc. It was very quiet when we arrived. With us( 4) there were probably only another 3 kids there. The retro games were on 2 arcade machines. They were tiny though. A modern arcade machine not like the ones in the arcadea when I was young. I'm sure these ones use a lot less power but when 2 people try to play at the same time, you really are squished in close and generally it's hard to play. Some. A good selection of Street Fighter games( sonic boom!) and some other games. I was. Very happy to see joust on one of the machines. Love that game and wasted a lot of my youth playing that. The kids played on the Nintendo Wii but there was no vr to be seen. Maybe it's hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it. The kids fired up the Xbox but it only had 1 controller so they could n't play together which was a shame. A huge selection of board games were available which was ace too.

Love that it's all clearly labelled, and that there's vegan flavours too. As I was the only person in the queue, staff really took her time with me, explaining the flavours and allowing me to taste them too. We ended going for two regular scoops(), the pistachio and oreo chocolate cheesecake which was also her favourite too. We also ordered two smaller scoops() of the birthday cake and chocolate, you ca n't go wrong with this really, can you ? Also an Americano, which we added some of the ice cream in, new twist. Great that you have the option of scoop size. There were also options for toppings too. Tasted fresh with amazing flavours, creamy and rich but not too sweet either, just right.

The food itself is amazing in my opinion: it is fully packed with tasty filling which also destroys your hunger by just eating one full meal. I liked the wide range of options especially for fries, where you could choose one from 4 types of the fries. The fillings of the kebab I had are decently harmonically combined. Price are relatively low, considering that the ood is worthy. I payed 11 pounds for kebab, fries and a drink. Nothing special about the service. Although, I am really good in speaking English, the one who took my order was patient enough to repeat some questions to me.

I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant, with a great ambient atmosphere. We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n\u2019t take long and the restaurant was \u2018 buzzing \u2019, it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n\u2019t order again. The gravy was far too thin \/ watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n\u2019t want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n\u2019t make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n\u2019t fault it. Beautiful Menu, great atmosphere, very good staff and definitely worth it.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":1.075040261e+20,"text":"Was my friends 21st birthday yesterday. His parents booked him a table at Cosmos Sheffield, invited family from Portugal and a few close friends. We were 21 in total. The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in \/ out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:-( it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it!

The sauces accompanying them complimented the food well. So why 2 * ? There is an amount of trust you need to have between a customer and a business, and when applying an already large %( discretionary) service charge, it should be correct. Charging over 9 on a 59 bill is not right at all, and it should not be the responsibility of the customer to notice this.

Occasionally, they feature a special of the day, although it not available every day. On the dessert front, the tiramisu is good, though not as standout as the pizza, and it on the smaller side. While I did n\u2019t try the coffee, I notice the young server craft a cappuccino for a colleague, and it looked quite nice.

The room was opposite the lift shaft and looked out on a flat roof and the air conditioning units, but, it was the cleanliness, or lack of it, l struggled with! It was n't the hairs and fluff in the sink, or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception, but, the hairs in the bed! At reception l apologised for complaining, but said l could n't sleep in a dirty bed. After a few visits to the room behind reception, the receptionist came back and assigned me a room on the third floor, almost directly above the first one! I duly moved to be met with a' punishment room, nowhere to sit, work, or put any of my toiletries, clothes etc, that is once l found somewhere to actually be able to open my case! However, l did n't even get that far, due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs, photos attached. I returned to reception, where l found myself apologising again and where the receptionist made it clear she was exasperated with me and basically asked me what l expected her to do with a full hotel! I explained that l would be happy just to have the sheets changed. Eventually, this is exactly what happened, the bed was changed by one of the other receptionists in the first room. So, l returned to the second floor, where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air! The toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working, as the others would not flush. We had set meal times, yesterday evening was supposed to be at 1830 hours, but, we were n't allowed in until 1925 hours, which messed up a drinks reception, due to commence in the bar area at 1930 hours, all of which had been arranged, with the hotel, weeks in advance! The food itself was n't particularly great, especially on the first evening, although, in fairness, lunch on both days, was much better.

Arrived on time to be told our table had been taken as a party of 6 had turned up earlier so would be available' soon'. Stood waiting for about 10 minutes then table became available. Waited on by Daniel, a very friendly & helpful staff member who took our order. The Mushroom Al Forno starters were lovely and arrived hot. Our mains, Lasagne & Pollo Cacciatore were equally as hot and very flavoursome. Apart from the initial problem upon entrance the visit was very much enjoyed and we would visit again. I would recommend to park in the Houndshill carpark if driving here as it is situated right next to Bella so perfect placement. Great food and essentially hot! * Update Dec' 23. Visited again while on a Xmas break. Had the mushroom Al Forno starter again but this time it was a disappointingly smaller portion than in July when we last visited. Ordered the lasagne as Bella IS the best but when it arrived it looked horrendous. The dish had burn marks all over it and the lasagne itself was as flat as a pancake! Not acceptable and certainly not the usual quality I receive. I called the waitress over, Karolina could not apologise enough and without excuses took my burnt dish away and 10 minutes later returned, again apologised and served me with a fresh, hot, bubbling and delicious lasange. That was much appreciated. Great service. Thank you Karolina","sentiment_label":1}

Now, I'll caveat this by saying that it seemed exceptionally busy for a Wednesday lunchtime, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked what the wait time for food would be. I did n't do this, and we ended up waiting for around 35 minutes after we'd been seated. I ordered the Badgers Beef Burger and my son the buttermilk chicken burger. Both meals come with a side of your choice. I got chunky chips, my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce. The beef burger was nice, but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry, though a mayo style dip is provided on the side. No complaints on the chicken burger from my son! The atmosphere in the bar is really nice though and the menu is extensive and well curated with a mix of traditional and contemporary meals and small plates on offer.

{"id":1.13712568e+20,"text":"Update 3 *) I went to see Matilda at 3 pm on the 1st of December the film was good but felt let down by the quality of the sound was really flat with minimal bass especially on a musical film. I paid the extra for the premier seats whilst being a different colour and a slightly higher back they really ai n't comfortable and I was starting to ache so had to keep moving about in my seat to get through the film whilst the seats look good the comfort was n't considered when they were made especially for sitting in for around 2 hours. The picture quality was really good with good brightness level. I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film. I really would like to see different straws available as the straws currently just go soggy and collapse around 20 minutes into the film I had 2 and had failed before I finished my large drink I ended up using a spare straw when I got back to my car I had from showcase wich lasted well for the rest of the drink This cinema is good but I would n't use it as my first choice as cinemas are a big part of me and the sound image and comfort are really important things to me for a great cinema experience. I do really like the screens outside so you can check the film that's showing before you go in it's a great idea and works well( picture taken as I left so shows film time of the showing after the one I watched) Original 4 *) I have n't been to a cinema in around 13 years i enjoyed my visit the person serving was friendly and really helpful we got are tickets and drinks we went for the large drinks because hey it's not a regular thing and might aswell go all out on it. The person scanning tickets could have been a bit more helpful I rely on things being made clear to me and because I seen the sign for screen one and not screen to as that was around the corner under the stairs it was difficult for me to understand wear it was the the person was friendly it would have been helpful to maby word and explain things a little different as some of us struggle with things like this also maybe move the sign for screen 2 so it can be seen as easy as screen 1 from wear the tickets get checked. The cinema was clean tidy and I really enjoyed the film we did notice that about of the way through many the Aircon came on or heating went off and started to get cold.

{"id":1.162795206e+20,"text":"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers. Come on management, get your thinking cap on.","sentiment_label":0}

It was our first time at this particular Tim Hortons, I've never been to any Tim full stop so this was my first experience. When we arrived it was busy but not rammed, there was a queue for food' collection' which was awkwardly set up as there's not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there's a table in the way of collection also. So that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which I'm adamant does n't work in food places but they keep doing it. They could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some McDonald do but I digress. As we'd never been we used the self serve to figure out what we'd like and the menu were clear and simple, but it was so we could go and order in person as I have a blue light card. The man said Tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal \/ offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that. The food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer. I got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious. Thanks to the deal, for 2 meals it cost us just under 15. All in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend.

Other dishes such as chilly paneer, chicken steamed momos and chicken fried rice was bang on! One weird thing-there was a really tiny pebble( we call it Kankar) when I took my first bite of the fried rice but other than that, the taste of the fried rice was really nice! I would love to go to this place again to try their thaali and fried momos. Majority of the people there were ordering the thaali so can not wait to be there again! Also, highly recommend to have a reservation before hand or else it super difficult to get a table.","sentiment_label":1}

One would have expected at least one decent slice of meat and a couple of smaller slices( I chose only Turkey), however, despite there being well over half the turkey on display with lots of meat, he literally shaved five slivers off the base. When we last visited Lincoln, we had a couple of generous slices, sadly when I mentioned this he replied it now on weight. That fine, I understand the business has to make a profit, overheads are a killer, but he did not weigh anything and just guessed at what he was serving up. Our group of four were all shocked as to the amount we received so it was not just myself. On top of that, the restaurant was very quiet with only a handful of filled tables, we sat for nearly half an hour after finishing our meals before the waitress came to our table. Again, had they been busy serving lots of tables this would have been acceptable, but that was not the case.

Good for Wimbledon which let face it that despite best efforts is pretty run down and soulless.( I think I speak with reasonable authority having been born and raised in SW19 and seen the downward decline in the name of modernisation over the last 50 years) Expect conventional but reasonably comfortable seats on a slight incline to allow good viewing. You not going to get the luxurious sofa with little tables and high quality seat service like The Everyman but you are a cut above the boring Odeon chain. You feel like you part of something in the middle. You are. Food: Nice selection of snacks.

If this was because it was an event open to the public let me turn that around and mention the fact that bar staff were not informed that tickets were open to the public and instead, when asked about what the event was were told \u201c it a private party \u201d. The lack of marketing for this event compared to others was shocking and the fact the people running it rang to check if under 18s were allowed multiple times and they were then turned away was abysmal.

The issue however was with the burgers... and it's not they really TASTED of it, but they smelt like a cow shed! I get it, it's beef but I want to taste and smell BEEF not COW. It was a mix of meat and... well, cow s * * * as my darling wife put it. It just completely put us off, whether it was a bad batch, or it's meant to be like that I'm not sure but was completely not for us. We left half of our food( see the pic), and no one questioned anything, did n't even ask if everything was okay-just cleared up and brought the bill. We booked for 7 pm-by we were walking out the door having been served, disappointed and paid!

So in a matter of minutes we had three members of staff including the manager asks us if everything was ok. Being British it felt a bit much, but actually they were very polite. The food was as always was consistent so chicken is chicken, not much to talk about here. The restaurant is very modern and spacious and there was a mixture of age groups and families eating in. The decor is well designed and interesting. They have plenty of space inside and outside under parasols but today it was raining and a bit cold so no one outside. It located in a partly pedestrianised area and parking is difficult. All in all great place professional staff and good food.","sentiment_label":1}

Walked in to a empty venue, after been greeted at the door we was given 1 menu between two of us and said just sit where ever. not a good start. Once we sat down I decided to get my own menu as we was n't given two. Poor... Waiting for table service, which never came, I saw a lady doing some sweeping. After trying to get her attention quite loudly, I found out she had AirPods in. Not good. Once she decided to not ignore us anymore she told us to go to the counter to order which we was never told at the begging. We had to shout through a thick plastic barrier. We're not in COVID any more, no need for a sound proof barrier anymore. And once we had ordered, they forgot our water. Wo n't be going back. Not surprised it was empty.

However, since cakes etc never goes on offers to finish them daily, therefore, sometime the stocks get old and may not be fresh. Gulaab jamen with khoya are the best I think. Bought sweet and half kg jalebi on 16.

Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n\u2019t see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n\u2019t think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n\u2019t risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n\u2019t quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n\u2019t hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more. There are other local Afternoon Teas that blow this out of the water.","sentiment_label":0}

I have never really been in the casino bit properly before now, and it was really busy.

When we ordered, we were asked how we wanted them cooked so we asked what the chef would suggest and were told this would be medium rare which we agreed to, but they were more medium to well done. This was not a massive problem as the meat was good quality, not fatty and very tasty. We did n\u2019t complain but our waitress asked how everything was so we told her. What was really good was that the manager came straight over and offered to bring out new steaks for us but we were hungry( we waited around 50 mins already) so said we eat them but he did offer us a complimentary dessert which was very much appreciated. The cheese platter we selected was delicious and absolutely huge so more than enough for us to share.

{"id":1.173431962e+20,"text":"At Mr Singh all vegetarian restaurant & takeaway vegetarians are treated to a delightful selection of meat-free alternatives that rival their carnivorous counterparts. From hot dogs to chicken burgers, tandoori chicken-style pizzas and delicious French fries, Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes. The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish, the chilli paneer pizza, which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite, which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu. While the food impresses, the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch. The d\u00e9cor and furnishings appear dated, detracting slightly from the overall dining experience for those choosing to dine in-restaurant. The Service is satisfactory but could be more attentive to elevate the dining experience further. As far as beverages go, Unfortunately, the milkshakes leave something to be desired, lacking the thick, creamy texture that milkshake aficionados crave. In conclusion, Mr Singh offers a vegetarian haven for those seeking flavorful meat-free options. While there are areas for improvement, such as updating the ambiance and refining the milkshake offerings, the delicious food makes it a worthwhile dining destination for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I go as far as saying in terms of takeaway pizzas it possibly up there as one of the best in the midlands & surrounding areas.","sentiment_label":1}

One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate.

More importantly, for the price-it not all that. Your local kebab shop would taste better I sure. Other than that, the calamari was good. Burgers were good. Pie of the day was good. Nothing outstanding but not too shabby. Service-they tried their best but the place was heaving on a Saturday night. Servers were brilliant. 1 star taken away due to the super long gap between starters and main meal considering they were pushing us to have our starters. good vibe. It a place where one has to shout at another to be heard. Drinks-these are lovely!! Costly but lovely nonetheless. We had some the Blackberry and Rhubard cooler was a fave!

Service is incredibly slow, food arrives barely warm and glasses arrive dirty. You'd expect that for a place with stars( currently November 2023), that the food would be great too. With a menu that is heavily aimed towards their' signature' hanging kebabs, you'd at least expect them to be good. Honestly, they were the driest kebabs I've ever had, apart from the one time I tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager. Haha. The pictures really appear more juicy than they are. The chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just.. cold. Really not good enough for the price they charge. Looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails( 80 % ice) and are also waiting for too long for their meals. A table behind me of just 4 guests had to ask twice where their food was, with 10 minute intervals. Oh and the rocket was barely fresh at all.

Gail Bakery is a curious nook in Altrincham town center that'll have you hooked and wanting to come back for more! The avocado toast was the stuff of legends, sending my taste buds on a rollercoaster ride of delight! But wait, it gets better! The secret weapon was the mysterious and alluring Salsa Verde sauce, served on the side like a daring sidekick ready to take on any culinary challenge! Speaking of challenges, I faced the flat white quest next. It was acceptable, though it lacked a bit of magic. Still, it played well with the avocado toast, so we'll call it a breakfast truce! Now, time to unravel the bagel enigma! The bagel, ceremoniously crowned with a luscious blend of Jam and butter, whispered sweet nothings into my taste receptors. Oh, how it charmed my senses! The space inside the bakery is a cozy hug; think of it as breakfast in a warm embrace! However, if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats, you'll have to roll the dice with the weather. Outdoor seating is a fair-weather friend, but when it cooperates, it's a treat! Attention parents, mini-humans are welcome here! The vibe is kid-friendly, and it's a decent spot to enjoy breakfast with your little ones as long as it's not peak hour madness! To sum it all up, Gail Bakery is like an enchanted breakfast nook that sprinkles a dash of quirkiness into your morning routine. Grab your avocado toast, dance with the Salsa Verda, and embark on a breakfast adventure! Just make sure to check the weather forecast before you set sail to claim the coveted outdoor seats!

Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits.

Food came in good time, chicken jalfrezi curry, rice, soft naan crispy poppadums plus chicken with a dip and chips.. chips could have been warmer but that was the only snag. The same eating experience could be had by visiting the ready meal section of a supermarket, heating it up at home with your own choice of music \/ TV. You still have to wash up. It's less fun, and cask ale tastes far better than cans or bottles. Drinks ordered on the app came super quick! Overall, it was a happy night for us. Amber Rooms is a big place, and we were lucky to get a seat. Very popular with students. Curry plus a pint on a Friday and many scrumy snack choices for under 6 why would n't it be.

A few days prior I was told the bar would be open but again another issue on the day, only 1 staff member working on the downstairs bar. Later on someone else did arrive to open the upstairs bar but had to leave. I do n\u2019t expect party guests to keep going up and down the stairs to fetch drinks. A big issue for a 1st birthday party was having no baby change facilities. This should of been stated at the time of booking. I would assume in 2024 baby change & disabled facilities are important and mandatory. I can not comment on the food here as luckily we took our own. To finish the overall poor experience with this venue, I completely forgot to ask for the deposit money back once our party had ended. It taken a week of actually going to the pub, calling, leaving voicemails and text messages to obtain my deposit back. I wo n\u2019t be returning obviously or recommending to anyone for future.","sentiment_label":0}

She rudely interrupted and said the bar would be getting busy, to which I replied I know, it not my first time here and we would move when it happens. She then aggressively said she would get the manager to move me away from the bar when there was no need. This caused further issues between myself and the barmaid. I very strongly suggest not to hire people like this at an establishment where dealing with customers is your main job.

From the moment I walked in, the energetic and lively atmosphere immediately set the tone for a fun dining experience. The staff at TGI Fridays were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit. Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours. However, the staff did their best to manage the crowd efficiently and keep waiting times to a minimum. Nevertheless, it's advisable to book a table in advance to avoid any potential delays. Despite the wait, TGI Fridays in Telford consistently delivers a reliable dining experience. The food is consistently flavorful, the service is attentive, and the environment is vibrant. Whether you are looking for a casual meal or a place to celebrate with friends, TGI Fridays is a great choice. I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you're in the area and craving some delicious American fare!","sentiment_label":1}

My wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order, and the options become quite limited wherever we go.

They were spicy and delicious. Came with a sour cream sauce and a kind of sweet chilly sauce. One thing I would highly suggest is to have halal chicken options. There are a lot of Muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses, but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff. Would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal. Overall very reasonably priced and tasty, could do with more halal and gluten free options.","sentiment_label":1}

Room was up to standard and I appreciated the tea \/ coffee making kit as it was wet and gloomy over my stay. The evening food menu was not very wide but my pizza was perfectly fine. The Continental breakfast was very good. The only downside for me was the peculiar car parking arrangements. The entrance to the hotel is basically in a pay and display car park so I had to feed a meter with 90 minutes credit in the afternoon and skedaddle early in the morning to avoid paying any more! For once probably best to be a pedestrian.","sentiment_label":1}

Only 1 time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft, all the other times it was warm. Even though we are only a 5 minute drive away( but do n't drive). On one occasion, I found a hair and called to complain. I was called a liar and when I asked to be put through to a manager I was told no manager was in but he'd leave a message. I never got a call back. Every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it, they put tandoori chicken on it. On their menu they have 4 different kinds of chicken, including plain. Logically, if it does n't mention what kind it is, you'd assume it means plain. We called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told \" of course! We'd never do otherwise \". Last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it! It's so strong tasting, it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza. We called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it's our fault that we did n't know that chicken means tandoori chicken. I asked if they can at least change the menu so it's obvious you're not getting plain chicken, but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid. According to the reviews on Just Eat, I am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description. This time I was apparently speaking to a shift manager, who clearly knows nothing about customer service. He was incredibly rude and spoke over me. I asked to speak to the store manager and was told they were n't in( on a Friday evening). I asked to leave a message to be called back and yes you guessed it, that call never came. Rude, disrespectful and argumentative.","sentiment_label":0}

Sat at a table trying to have a chat but could n't hear each other because the music was too feels a very weird place to sit in as there's loads of random mental decor. Nothing flowed the interior designer should be sacked for starters. The table did n't feel clean. The coffee was literally half a cup of foam. We had a big breakfast a sausage and bacon buttie, coffee and a coke. It came to 28 quid. So certainly not cheap. The staff were shouting across the dining area whilst we were trying to eat. The sofa and chairs was n't very nice to eat on at all. The sausages were not nice, coffee was OK just half a cup. The bacon was nice, egg was snotty, i had to ask for sauce, black pudding was OK. But the whole experience made me feel so uncomfortable I could n't even finish my breakfast. I had nicer breakfasts from road side vans if I'm honest. Wo n't be going back needless. it looks alot better than it tastes. The venue probably makes it seem worse.","sentiment_label":0}

The chicken biriyani was n't for me as it had a lot of bones in it and I was n't a fan of the taste. The Rogan Josh was okay, I could taste a lot of cardamom in it. We ordered the Tiramisu Milk Cake for dessert. It was Amazing! We both absolutely loved it!","sentiment_label":1}

Going to the screen rooms they all lead off the same corridor no more steps of any kind. Once inside yes there's steps to your seat. I brought half a lager for just 3. Wow. I was there for a VIP screening; very spacious, small tables in-between seats for refreshments and get comfy the seats roll so you can sit upright or slope your body.

It was comfortable to sit on the leather that is accompanied by a table, after ordering on the machine then waiting at the counter, which displays the options clearly and has facilities like the napkins I picked up. My Zinger Burger, chips and Robinson drink were all delicious, which I ate in a clean area before discarding my waste in an appropriately sized bin! The staff could have sorted out this restaurant better though since the machine did not print order receipts and they were careless bagging my drink, causing it to spill on some of the food. I went here again and waited 10 minutes for 2 Hot Wings, yet the staff were considerate in giving me 6 ones that tasted piping fresh.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":1.133875736e+20,"text":"Been here many times and this review should be 5 stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ? The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of \u201c scruffy \u201d experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.","sentiment_label":0}

The staff are attentive, friendly, punctual, well mannered, professional, understanding and respectful. The food and drink cost which is reasonable. I have been here today with friend and another person although I got quick service the ground floor but friend has waited for the food for 15 minutes by then food got warm.

The curry sauce which was served with it was covered in oil. Coleslaw was sour. When desserts came. Fudge cake was like cardboard. Ice cream advertised as 3 scoops came as 2 teaspoons full served in a warm glass. As a positive though. Our server Katie was fantastic with us. She was so helpful.
