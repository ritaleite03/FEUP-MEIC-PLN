The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine.

In the event of an emergency( fire) the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building! The evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand.

Such bright colours, imagination, creativity, thought, skill, talent and time has obviously gone into these beautiful works of art( paintings). Loved the ceiling and stained glass at top of Street view windows. Very small, busy, I would say thriving little Cafe. Apparently their Chicken & Leek Frittatas are absolutely amazing, and hefty sized great looking Caesar Salad delicious also. The Frittatas and Mini( muffin sized) Quiche were each( alone, with no side salad), nice looking foccacias each. Latte & Soy Latte were both of extremely good quality, strong, tasteful cuppas. Would call again, will be trying their huge Caesar Salad next time, at only! The menu had a couple of lesser prices on it, than current prices. Specials board behind the counter. Also offering healthy, tasty and beautifully presented smoothies. Simple, FREE and easy angle parking adjacent to St Georges Square, alternatively 15 minute kerbside parking right outside the door! Convenient location, easy to stop and grab a cuppa on your way to work or wherever. Phone box across the Street. Outside dining options, lovely frontage, prime location, easily accessible to all. A wonderful park across the street( St Georges Square), and also a great playground just over High Street, a simple, pleasant short walk away. Highly recommend, even just for a drink and to view the wonderful artwork by the extremely talented employee!","sentiment_label":1}

Unfortunately the food in the restaurant was very average. I had the salmon which came with a generous serving of mashed sweet potato and some broccoli. The salmon was very dry and with no sauce.

Du Cane Brewery was a suggestion. So off we went. I walked past before, and thought it looked interesting and chill. The sort of place good to while away a slow Sunday afternoon \u2026 well, it did n\u2019t disappoint. We asked for a Pizza recommendation and Forest was suggested. So we chose that and a Sopressa endowed one. I definitely thought the Sopressa Pizza was going to be the tastier one. I was wrong. The Forest, was tasty, moist and different. It was very delicious. The Sopressa was fine, but it was The Forest that really stood out! Of course we ordered too much, so we took home almost the equivalent of a whole Pizza. Which tasted great the next day, too! Loved the chill, but pretty bustling atmosphere. No hurrying here, and no rousting the customers after a certain time. We loved the pizza, the layout and our first coffees were pretty good too. Four stars only because second coffees were too milky and slopped in the saucer at serving. It fine. Love the kids area. Great initiative and really extends the place for everyone. Even four legged friends are welcome here. It so relaxed. There a style of seating for everyone and an ambience that is inviting and, most importantly, when the Cafes are closed for food-Du Cane has the goods. It was a lovely Sunday visit. And I definitely be taking my other daughter from interstate there too! She love it. It great for space, conversation, coffee and really good PIZZA!","sentiment_label":1}

Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly. Finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid 7 for the cookie and a total of 55 for not a great product.

Victoria Square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful.

Their fluffy hotcakes were beautifully plated with fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, edible flowers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was topped with a generous amount of custard which made the hot cakes a tad too sweet for my liking. The malteser shake could not be finished as it was too sweet for my liking. The chilli scrambled eggs were savoury and perfectly seasoned. It is really delightful to pair those eggs with sliced avocado and slightly toasted sourdough. It was overall an enjoyable experience.

The staff are welcoming, although we did feel a little rushed to order. The food took quite a while, but it was delicious when it arrived. We had a white pizza( essentially cheesy garlic bread), I had salmon fettuccine and partner had a creamy marinara seafood spaghetti. They were well presented and well cooked-for me personally, a little too much lemon used in my dish but by no means made it unpleasant. We also had a couple of glasses of red wine which was really nice. The atmosphere was lively and inviting. As well as eating in, they offer takeaway and there was a steady stream of customers coming in to collect orders in the hour and 30 mins( or so) that we were there, so it obviously a popular spot. Toilets are out the back of the restaurant, which felt a little strange to get to-you go through a door from the main restaurant and into a sort of courtyard where there a lot of restaurant items but the facilities were clean and well kept.

I feel kind of mean, only giving them 4 stars, but there was just something that was n't quite \" right \". Apart from the overwhelming clutter that passes for decor, we really enjoyed our meal, choosing 3 items from the smaller tapas menu and a salad, instead of having a main. The Chili mussels were kind of small and did n't quite make it to \" perfect \" level despite a tasty and nicely hot sauce. The arancini balls were smushy inside, instead of distinctly \" risotto-like \". The garlic prawns were to die for... tender, plump, huge and tasty. But the thing that really intrigued me was the salad, which was \" bean, heads of broccoli and peas \". A quick read of the menu seemed to indicate that these three are the only green vegetables the chef knows how to prepare. They appeared on the other menu options. As my hubby says..., broccoli and peas must have been cheap this. There was nothing wrong exactly. All the food was tasty and well-presented. There was just something undefinable missing.

Not sure whether they're trying to go fine dining, family-orientated, or small business-like. They fail in any category. Food is not terrible. In fact it was n't bad by my taste. Still far, far below my expectations for what I was told was fine dining. Some elements did not seem very freshly made. Summing, poor quality control. Served by a very polite waitress who tried her best and I can appreciate that. Not tablecloth, but you can not try themselves for not being trained. The atmosphere is terrible. I almost thought to call it rustic, but that's simply trying to reframe outdated and worn out.

The mushrooms, prawns and fried chicken all had this sauce that had a golden syrup type flavour. It's a real shame because the mushrooms were incredible as were the prawns but they were ruined by the sauce. We were going to stay for a main, but we're nervous that sauce would be on the main as well( it was n't on the gyozas and they were absolutely lovely but again, the sauce it did come with was a little odd).

Food-BIR style curry that's prevalent in Australia( standard curry base which is built upon to order). Beef Bhuna with garlic naan. The flavour profile of the Bhuna was quite good-heat was on point and well spiced. Texturally sound as well( I dislike overly smooth gravies, which this fortunately is n't). Cumin forward on the flavour profile( quite dominant). Whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet-Bhuna is a dry curry and I wish it was n't served drowned in gravy. Maybe this is what other customers prefer-I like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid. The naan was a little disappointing, lacking the smoky tandoor flavour I'm used to, and there was n't a pronounced garlic flavour. Service-absolutely lovely.

More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg.

Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n\u2019t finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies.

The pool was not heated and whilst it was open was not tolerable due to the intense cold temperature. I noted only a couple of kids who braved the water whilst we were there. We did try and lasted only a couple of minutes. We deliberately booked the hotel due to the indoor heated pool over an Airbnb house as we both have medical conditions in which we need to regularly rehab in the pool. The one time we did brave it we were in more pain when we got out. Additionally the bar fridge made so much noice that at night we slept with the tv on to drown out the noise of the fridge. Our room was cleaned daily however was not vacuumed the entire time we were there as dirt on the carpet was there when we arrived and there when we left. Overall a very disappointing experience.

I would never order it again, far too plain and boring. The customer service was excellent. The only issue I noticed throughout the night was that everyone in the restaurant that had ordered pizza was waiting for their meals for a while, which was really annoying because most people came with their partners, so whoever ordered pasta would get that first, and then whoever ordered pizza would get it 10mins later-which defeats the purpose of eating together at a restaurant.

Generally everything I had here has been good but in this review I be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day. The prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than I prefer. Personally I like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour, but that just me. The prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though. The steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked. The meat was n\u2019t as warm as I liked and the caramelised onions were n\u2019t as flavoursome as they looked to be. Overall you could n\u2019t taste much else and the sandwich( 22 I think) was only half a sandwich. Would have liked the whole thing for that price. The chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain. Tasted like there was n\u2019t any seasoning at all on them. A jug of lemon-lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better. Will have to write another review the next time I visit.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":1.114373351e+20,"text":"I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. 1. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. 2. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. 3. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes. The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions were notably small, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent. Overall, while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant, the food quality, particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes, did not meet expectations. The pricing, coupled with the small portions, further detracted from the overall dining experience. I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers.","sentiment_label":0}

This is something that you can not know until you get there. Management please just spend a few hundred dollars and fix it. Nice food in the bistro.","sentiment_label":1}

When I was served, I ordered a coffee and was bluntly told they did n\u2019t accept dirty keep cups( I had made a coffee at home when leaving). I understand it is not ideal having a dirty cup, but the way it was handled, in a rude, blunt tone was not good customer service. I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":1.073612126e+20,"text":"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding.","sentiment_label":1}

We then just wondered around before discovering where to order, by the same staff member that stared at us. The tables were grotty and old and the seats had more stains on them than a 20 year old chair. I then went to order drinks, big mistake. Female staff member stared at me again while they tendered to another customer. I waited over 5 minutes after being stared at. At about minute 4, some guy walked in and sat at the bar. How rude I was to think I was to be served first. Shame on me. I was passively aggressively ignored until their needs were met and then finally served at a sloths pace. Bar staff did n't care at all.
