{"id":"1ctzm63","text":"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.\n\nGenocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. \n\n**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky \"objective\" part.\n\nThe first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. \n\nWhen the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed [International Tribunal]( Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ([ICTY]( \n\nThis is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. \n\nThe right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d5j6wm","text":"This is an old post I\u2019ve shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit \n\nAustralian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.\n\nOkay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.\n\nFor the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.\n\nAustralia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.\n\nThe very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.\n\nOur spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the '50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.\n\nSouth America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).\n\nEdit: I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes:non-lethal snakes for a few different countries here. Australia ain't so bad.","sentiment_label":0}

We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.\n\nIf it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.\n\nI believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.\n\nI also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.\n\nIsn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1cvixc3","text":"Mining:    \n\n>The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning. The one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for 10 percent of your operating costs, but it\u2019s available for existing facilities as well as new ones. And it doesn\u2019t have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production.    \n\n\n\nSuper Tax Breaks:    \n\n>They probably don\u2019t involve the same degree of economic costs. They have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality, and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain, which is fraying. And so, the big one, the biggest hole is super tax breaks. So, they\u2019re costing 45 billion a year.\n\n>It\u2019s about 2 percent of GDP. They\u2019ll pretty soon cost more than the age pension. They\u2019re obviously not very well targeted. Half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households. I put these in two buckets. There\u2019s the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it\u2019s not going to hurt you too much.\n\n>And that is title limits on pretax contributions. It\u2019s raising the tax rate on some of those pre-tax contributions through division 293 tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool. And if you do those, there\u2019s 3 or 4 billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end.\n\n>And then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age 60, you\u2019re not going to pay any tax on your earnings. You basically had to check out of the tax system and that\u2019s costing Australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year. And that\u2019s not really sustainable in the long term.    \n\n\n\nNDIS:   \n\n>Yeah, look, and look, this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that\u2019s growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that\u2019s growing slower than the economy, you know, you know, you\u2019ve got something you\u2019ve got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we\u2019re willing to pay.\n\n>At the outset of the NDIS, there was a really important you know, piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to, into employment and that\u2019s part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself. Was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve? [they lean towards it being largely erroneous].       \n\n\n\nHousing:   \n\n>I think that\u2019s a great question. And the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we haven\u2019t built enough. That\u2019s why housing in part is so expensive. It\u2019s not the only factor, but it\u2019s certainly a factor that we have some control over. And if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy.    \n\n\n\nHealthcare:   \n\n>As the Commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well, you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports, you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government. And so, you see you know, we, we\u2019ve seen historically, the Commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care.    \n\n>And leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals. Or in the case of the NDIS, you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state-based settings. And as the states have less money to spend, they\u2019re going to be less cooperative in, in, in those conversations.\n\n>And I think this comes back to the fact that Australian Federation wasn\u2019t well designed on the tax side. We\u2019ve got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states, downstream services sitting with states, but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\nJob Seeker:\n\n>Look, it\u2019s a really tough one, because I think it\u2019s clear that we need the rise. So, JobSeeker for a long time has been well below the level that I think allows people to be empowered to go and find work as well as survive.\n\n>If they\u2019re on that payment for a while, we\u2019ve seen increases for originally from the Coalition and then in Labor last year. That mean that the payments gone up by 45 a week in real terms. Our position had always been it needed to rise by at least 100 a week. So, we\u2019re still 55 dollars a week away from that. I could have imagined a world where we did more of that.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d0r77q","text":"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. \n\nDuring the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.\n\nMy landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. \n\nStrata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. \n\nWe had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. \n\nAnd look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. \n\nOthers can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.\n\nEdit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them\/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable.

{"id":"1d4yqmo","text":"One of Australia\u2019s most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world\u2019s third-largest population of sheep \u2013 behind China and India \u2013 but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don\u2019t have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems\u2019 capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government\u2019s Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country\u2019s transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.\n\nA key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don\u2019t work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow \u2013 ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn\u2019t rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?\n\nThe battery strategy sets out a \u201cvision\u201d over the next decade, in which Australia becomes \u201ca globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition\u201d.\n\nWe certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers\u2019 know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!\n\nThe global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan\u2019s Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing \u201cimpurities\u201d such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.\n\nOur graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government\u2019s battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated \u2013 note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn\u2019t stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThe potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.\n\nThermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.\n\nThere is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.\n\nThe recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government\u2019s battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a \u201cbattery breakthrough\u201d initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on \u201chigh-value battery products\u201d that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an \u201cAustralian-made battery precinct\u201d in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.\n\nThe implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US\u2019s anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.\n\nOf course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the Rudd\u2013Gillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.\n\nWhatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government\u2019s battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.","sentiment_label":1}

Every apartment has a planter with built in irrigation. \n\nThere's storage cages on the roof, bike storage, lots of new washing machines, beautiful roof views and close to everything good.\n\nObviously NG use a ballot system so you can't just roll up and put money down.

{"id":"1d2h47p","text":"TL:DR \n\nGet financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. \n\nCentrelink are useless. \n\nQuality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum\u2019s advocate. \n\n\n\nI was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It\u2019s a nightmare!\n\nHere are my pro-tips!\n\n*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. \n\nFrom memory it cost about $3500. \n\nThey also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. \n\n*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. \n\nYou will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. \n\nBecause I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. \n\nI actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. \n\nI\u2019ve just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let\u2019s not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! \n\n*Aged Care - family visits are a must.

You try and build a city then you impact both those industries which especially in the case of agriculture, Australia needs. I think what should happen is the capital cities be built better, expand upwards rather than outwards. Saves looking for places for new cities","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d2iyux","text":"The article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people.\n\nDirect democracy can't fail to achieve the good of the majority, although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason. I was going to include compassion, however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end: it's part of the wisdom in \"do unto others as you would have others do unto you\".\n\nHowever, direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out. Nothing is perfect, but better is more useful than worse or the same.\n\nTherefore, I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy, to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment; along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it; basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum; and reduced working hours to allow them to participate.\n\nFreedom of speech, not freedom of action, needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings. Speech has no meaning in itself, only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action, which is why it needs to be free. Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver, not the speaker: the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech, especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech.\n\nAs for being hateful or hurtful to feelings, feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out, within each individual person, outside of the control of a speaker. Whilst a speaker's intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda, those emotions are created by the recipient, for good or ill, as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party. We are not our brothers keeper.\n\nIt is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions, with reason, so that they don't take action that becomes the source of objective harm. Speech is not action or cause of action: that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech, internally as well as externally.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d5q1gh","text":"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:\n\nAdelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild\/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. \"5 minutes from a beach\" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.\n\nBrisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of \"city beach\" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.\n\nCanberra - inland city in the \"mountains\", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.\n\nDarwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered \"waterfront\" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.\n\nHobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.\n\nMelbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay\/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.\n\nPerth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable\/close (moreso than a lot of people think).\n\nSydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking\/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so \"being 5 minutes from a beach\" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture\/lifestyle in Sydney.\n\nSo those are the capitals\/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:\n\n[Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)](\n\n[Sydney (tour of several most popular beaches)](\n\n[Adelaide (Henley Beach)]( [Adelaide (Brighton Beach)]( [Adelaide (Grange Beach)]( [Adelaide (Glenelg Beach)]( [Adelaide (Glenelg Beach)](  [Adelaide (Semaphore Beach)]( [Adelaide (Aldinga Beach)]( [Adelaide (Christie's Beach)]( [Adelaide (Sellick's Beach)]( [Adelaide (Maslin Beach)]( - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)\n\n[Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton)](\n\n[Gold Coast (Surfer's Paradise)]( - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.\n\n[Darwin (Waterfront)]( - very limited area you can actually swim, but it is literally almost always 32\u00b0C\n\n[Hobart (Nutgrove Beach)]( - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.\n\nHowever, you might want to consider some smaller\/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:\n\nNSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle\n\nQLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon\n\nSA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta\/Wallaroo, Port Elliot\/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay \n\nTAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay\n\nVIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale\n\nWA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay\n\nThere are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":"1d05ofu","text":"I would encourage everyone to read the AAT decisions in question before they leap to any conclusions. In [the XRGY decision]( for example, the human-trafficking allegations were given serious consideration. But the allegation came from ASIO and the AFP declined to prosecute him for the crime. From 53:\n\n>In the absence of a criminal conviction the decision-maker should rarely find that the conduct which would constitute an offence has occurred\u00a0. . . The task of ASIO is a different task to that of adducing criminal guilt. It is the AFP that is best placed to investigate, charge and refer to the Director of Public Prosecutions cases of people smuggling. In the Applicant\u2019s case, it has not done so. . . . If the Tribunal were to prefer or put more weight on the ASIO material than the AFP material, such an approach would raise Constitutional separation of power issues.\n\nGiven the above, it wasn't really possible for the AAT to treat the allegations any other way. This is trial by media, essentially.\n\nI haven't looked for the Saki decision, but the minister's comments may well be accurate: that the AAT didn't properly consider the likelihood of reoffending. Easy to say in retrospect, of course, but even so, it's not evidence that the direction is a problem, just its application.\n\nI know Dutton (and possibly others here) think we should be able to apply extra-judicial punishment to non-citizens. Serve your time and then piss off home. Untested allegation? Too bad, get out. But not only is this a textbook authoritarian approach, and not only does it compromise our international obligations including those against non-refoulement ([discussion here]( there's also the fact that the international community could start doing it to us. Deporting all their hardened criminals to our shores for us to deal with.

It can get really busy especially on weekends, midweek less of an issue. \n\nLake Mountain doesn't have any downhill skiing - cross country only (as well as snow play). It's also very low in altitude so unreliable for conditions - if you wanted to to go there to see snow you'd have to keep an eye on the weather and conditions as it may well be sloppy or bare.\n\nBaw Baw can get decent snow but it's a very small area with short lifts and trails. It would be cheaper than Buller so there's that. I've never been there so can't say much more.\n\nMy favourite option in Victoria is Falls Creek - IMO it has the best variety of terrain, the best views, the best conditions, and less queues than Buller. However it is too far for a day trip. For 2 nights though I'd say it's worth it going to Falls Creek. It might be hard and\/or expensive to get accommodation at this late stage though. Definitely worth the extra distance though if it's possible. \n\nFinally - if your visitors are coming from overseas, I'd question if going skiing here is really something they want to do here. If they're coming from a country where they already ski, it's unlikely to be better here. And if not, it's likely they can travel and ski somewhere where it will be cheaper and better than it is here.

It can be a pretty wide range of hours from 20,000 - 100,000 hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components, screen brightness & other settings, environment it was being used in, so on and so forth. Some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans (with lots of caveats).\n\nHow many hours per day did you use the monitor? What brightness level? Was the room it was in hot or humid? Did it get direct sunlight? Etc etc etc.  Multiply the amount of hours you used it by 4 years, take off a bunch for whatever conditions, and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor, then you can argue (per Australin consumer law) that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it isn't meeting the expected lifespan.\n\nBut if your rough estimate of total hours of use is around what is expected for your monitor, you're going to have a much harder time arguing that point.","sentiment_label":1}
{"id":"1d5rzal","text":"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.\n\nSince the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.\n\nReally, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.\n\nThe prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.\n\nThe purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.\n\nIt's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.\n\nThe issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.\n\nSubjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it? The ends don't justify the means.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d39ehz","text":"NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the \u201cunilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor\/Greens coalition.\n\n\u201cIt is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally \u2013 Israel \u2013 to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,\u201d Mr Leeser told The Australian. \u201cBut how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?\u201d \u201cThis is not an environmental party,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.\u201d\n\n\u2018What is Adam Bandt advocating for?\u2019: Labor MP questions Greens leader\u2019s announcement\n\nOnly five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.\n\nSpeaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not \u201cjust a symbolic move.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a concrete step towards peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.\u201d Mr Bandt said the \u201cscale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.\u201d\n\n\u201cA health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.\u201d\n\nHe warned that a \u201chuman engineered famine\u201d was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that \u201camounts to collective punishment of these people.\u201d\n\nMr Bandt said that Labor\u2019s credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you \u201crecognise just one side.\u201d\n\n\u201cLabor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,\u201d he said. \u201cLabor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201d Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting \u2018un-Australian values\u2019\n\nAssistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.\n\n\u201cWhy he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,\u201d Mr Watts said..\n\n\u201cSimplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWedge politics only divides the community,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution \u2026 but the Greens aren\u2019t serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. \u201cWe see no role for them in this,\u201d he said. \u201cA Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority \u2026 We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.\u201d\n\nMr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. \u2018End the occupation\u2019: Greens Leader calls for Labor to 'take action' against Israel\n\n\u201cThis motion \u2026 sends the message that Hamas\u2019 violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.\u201d\n\nHe also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women\u2019s rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the \u201ccause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.\u201d\n\nMr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had \u201cbecome a central plank of Green philosophy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October \u2013 even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cThey refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.\u201d\n\nMr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.\n\nReflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed \u201chow hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.\u201d","sentiment_label":0}

It doesn't get better because most of us still miss the thing we need most- community, real community. Here's another perspective and a blunt one: I have it 'all', a 3mil house with no debt, I run a business that I only work 5 hrs on per week, I have a great husband and two beautiful sons. We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community. And it took me 10 years and money to realise that I'm deeply bored and unhappy. Nothing really excites me, except my kids milestones and smiles. How is that doing anything for the world? Just sitting here unhappy making money for the government in my secure safe little box. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I think most people hit this realisation ar a certain age and you only have a choice to keep at it or fuck it all off.\n\nSo we are selling our home and business this year, travelling to poorer countries, helping how we can, and experiencing life outside of the box. I feel SO MUCH better, SO relieved that there's 'more'. I'm actually elated, I rarely had that feeling anymore for years.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, it's unlikely a job and house and family will make you feel better. Assuming you're not depressed, just stuck in the cycle. Deep dive into who YOU are - not what you're told to be, and there's always an answer. Then just say yes.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1ctv2cf","text":"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday\u2019s budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.\n\nLabor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.\n\nAdvertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.\n\nInfrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. \u201cThe majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,\u201d Ms King told the Financial Review. \u201cThe Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered.\u201d Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those \u2013 14 small projects worth about $444 million \u2013 were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory\u2019s election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money \u2013 about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor\u2019s signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money \u2013 about $136 million \u2013 went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to \u201cbail out\u201d Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. \u201cIt should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,\u201d Senator McKenzie said. \u201cThis government spreadsheet has only one colour, and it\u2019s a sea of red.\u201d stashes away billions for road and rail project announcements ahead of federal election.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1cveo31","text":"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.\n\nThe saga of Miles Morgan Australia\u2019s involvement in the \u201cFuture Fit\u201d turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.\n\nIt is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.\n\nMiles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.\n\nMacnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.\n\nTogether with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.\n\nMiles Morgan Australia\u2019s involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.\n\nMeals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.\n\nThe government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had \u201ca deep understanding\u201d of the needs and a \u201cstrong working relationship with the Department\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department\u2019s requirements,\u201d the submission prepared for Colbeck says.\n\n\u201cThis procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.\u201d\n\nDespite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an \u201copen tender\u201d.\n\nThat contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.\n\nWithin months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the \u201ccapability\u201d for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1csw003","text":">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.\n\nAllegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.\n\nOnce in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.\n\nI acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.\n\nThe proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.\n\nIn our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.\n\nWhilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.\n\nJustice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.\n\nCrimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.\n\nI urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.\n\nI think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.\n\nIf a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.\n\n>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.\n\nIf an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.\n\nHowever, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.","sentiment_label":0}

They don\u2019t want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.\u201d  \nThe AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to \u00adallowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.\n\nIf the offer is rejected, Mr \u00adCaruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. \u201cWe would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other \u00adplaces like Holsworthy etc, we\u2019re not actually putting the community at risk. \u201cIf the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far.

He later said he had seen the government\u2019s press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.\n\nHenskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor\u2019s laws.\n\nHowever, Henskens\u2019 push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.\n\nGreenwich said he had been in parliament for \u201cfive premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments\u201d, and he had never seen a proposal with \u201csuch disrespect to stakeholders in this space\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don\u2019t want to consult with them,\u201d Greenwich said.\n\u201cThey want to rubber stamp something they haven\u2019t ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.\u201d\n\nLeong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.\n\nShe said Henskens\u2019 attempts to ram through the bill smacked of \u201crelevance deprivation\u201d.\n\nLeader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.\n\n\u201cThe bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,\u201d Hoenig said.\nAttorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that \u201call their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state\u201d.\nDomestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be \u201cconsidered properly\u201d before being passed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.\nAt the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.\n\nThere will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender\u2019s release in the Supreme Court.\n\nA requirement for magistrates and judges to consider \u201cred flag\u201d behaviour such as animal cruelty, stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced, while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families.","sentiment_label":0}

OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.\n\n-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues \n\n- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. \n\n-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? \n\nI erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. \n\nMy suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don\u2019t use it to date, it\u2019s frowned upon but once you get out there you\u2019ll meet people anyway. \n\nThere is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. \n\nI am an introvert so it\u2019s perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. \n\nI am not single luckily, I wouldn\u2019t want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. \n\nThere are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it\u2019s so toxic. \n\nGo meet people in real life, they tend to be more genuine.","sentiment_label":0}

That has really put Albo on the back foot.\n\nAs I said with no budget until just before the next election he doesnt have much of a chance to reset the publics perception. The media will keep piling on with the landlord\/private jet\/out of touch stuff and Dutton will keep quiet. QLD a major swing state also has a crime problem and an ex police Qlder will probably do well.\n\nI still think Albo can win a majority but he needs something big to turn it around.

{"id":"1cpqqgf","text":"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.\n\n\u201cYou actually can\u2019t have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn\u2019t begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,\u201d says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.\n\nThe way people in her focus groups see it, she says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show\u201d.\n\nTo an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018We can\u2019t get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people\u2019,\u201d says Huntley.\n\nIt\u2019s not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.\n\nPauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.\n\nOf course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being \u201cswamped by Asians\u201d. Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being \u201cswamped by Muslims\u201d.\n\nIn her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\n\u201cWas I right?\u201d she asked her fellow senators. \u201cYou\u2019d never admit it, but yes I was,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.\n\nIt has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is a\u00a0good thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia\u2019s immigration intake.\n\nIan Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.\n\nLowe was president of the country\u2019s pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10\u00a0years until 2014.\n\nDuring that time, he tells\u00a0*The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to \u201cprosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure\u201d. The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be \u201ctaken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment\u201d.\n\n\u201cCutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer \u2026 The boost to government budgets is enormous.\u201d\n\nSo the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today \u2013 as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia\u2019s population is on track to grow to about 40 million people \u2013 an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane \u2013 by 2060.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d0p5nx","text":"He claimed that by \u201crebalancing the migration program \u2026 the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.\u201d\n\nHow this number was calculated, he didn\u2019t say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.\n\nThere is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia\u2019s borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.\n\nAccording to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia\u2019s record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.\n\nBut, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan\u2019s deputy director of migration and labour markets, \u201casking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it\u2019s a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.\u201d\n\nMigrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, \u201cit looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.\n\n\u201cSuch a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.\u201d\n\nWith all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton\u2019s proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.\n\nWhat is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.\n\nThis is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.\n\nWhen the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.\n\n\u201cIn 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost \u2026 numbers,\u201d says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. \u201cPolicies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.\n\n\u201cThe message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,\u201d says Rizvi.\n\nThe changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government\u2019s shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.\n\nIn contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, \u201cScott Morrison told students to just go home,\u201d says Honeywood.\n\n\u201cThat caused incredible damage to Australia\u2019s reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d5vino","text":"Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!\n\nConceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.\n\nSo we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.\n\nThe ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).\n\nThis brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.\n\nIsrael is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. \n\nIt is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.\n\nAustralia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** \n\nThere is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.\n\nSo, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d59r41","text":"I drink espresso so don\u2019t really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. \n\nI just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is \u201cUniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance\u201d and has \u201cconsistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art\u201d costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. \n\nA litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn\u2019t it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn\u2019t throwing away stock. \n\nPerhaps I\u2019m over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don\u2019t know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. \n\nI will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about a) I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b) I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that\u2019s as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I\u2019m definitely not a customer of yours and I don\u2019t really care what the cost of a coffee is. I\u2019m simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that\u2019s hardly the case now.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d34ukx","text":">I feel like I'm done with this industry\n\nYeah, every single person I know who has ever been a chef reached that point. It's just a shitty job - the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time. Working when you should be on a break.\n\nA well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run. You could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find... You could create a good kitchen, but honestly if you're burned out and over it, then that's probably not the best option. A good manager is passionate about the job and you probably can't do that anymore. Maybe in a few years you might be able to.\n\nIf you can finish your Cert 4 easily, then absolutely do that. The piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job, maybe the one after that. It's worth having.\n\nYou could honestly do almost anything. A good mate of mine became a school teacher (they tried to get him to teach kids to cook... but he told them to fuck off. Literally dropped an F bomb in that meeting). He teaches maths and science. Doesn't have any particular aptitude for either subject, but he can read a high school textbook and that's all you really need (plus a relevant degree in teaching, obviously. He had to spend four years in university to get that - worked in a kitchen part time while studying)\n\nOr, you could do what another mate did and move laterally - he's a hotel manager now. The hotel has a kitchen obviously, and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job, but doesn't actually work in the kitchen.\n\nUltimately, put your mental health first and get out of the situation you're in. You don't have to do it instantly - just start moving in that direction. You'll feel so much better once you've taken the first step, trust me. I'm in the middle of a similar transition myself (different industry though) \u2014\u00a0still working the job I don't like but I won't be much longer and that's made a huge difference.","sentiment_label":0}

It\u2019s the same as perfume or designer handbags. They are 5000% markup \u00a0. Criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that 5000% differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk.\n\n\n\u00a0I like the New Zealand approach. The government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year. Eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers. The price of the tobacco is reasonable and so there is no market for the criminal gangs to make a profit with illegally important tobacco.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Both schemes achieve the same thing . The Australian approach is really quite dumb, compared to the New Zealand approach.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1cupgad","text":"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.\n\nTwo senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told\u00a0*The Saturday Paper*\u00a0that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue \u201cwould not be revisited before the election\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,\u201d says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. \u201cThat and nothing else.\u201d\n\nMost of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.\n\nSave the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nIn November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children\u2019s application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cAustralian citizenship has to mean something,\u201d says Tinkler. \u201cBeing a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?\u201d\n\nIn a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.\n\n\u201cAANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,\u201d Barton said.\n\nIn 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.\n\nIn October 2022, Labor\u2019s Home Affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.\n\nLast week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, a\u00a0terrorist organisation.\n\nRaad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.\n\nKamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy\u2019s return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister\u2019s office, and the pain of it hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they\u2019re doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,\u201d says Dabboussy.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1czaput","text":"Not really. The gist of Michael West's article is what's known as the doctrine of command responsibility.\n\n[\n\nIt comes about when senior leaders did not *order* war crimes, but they *knew or should have known* and stopped them. This applies to military leaders, of course, which is what McBride was upset about. But it applies to political leaders, too - since ultimately, in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership. \n\nJust think of it this way. Let's imagine that our intervention in Afghanistan had been a stunning success. Let's say that today - because of Australia's intervention - the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy. Do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit?\n\nOf course. So - if you're to take the credit when things go well under your leadership, you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly. \n\nThat's the doctrine of command responsibility. As the wikpedia article quotes,\n\n>*The Prosecutor v.*\u00a0[*Delali\u0107*](\u00a0*et al.*\u00a0(\"the \u010celebi\u0107i case\") first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that \"had reason to know\" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have \"had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of\u00a0... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether\u00a0... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.\"\n\nReturning to the article, a link within it,\n\n[\n\nnotes that then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith was in 2012 made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days. There is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims - in fact he publicly denied them. \n\nThe Minister for Defence is in overall control of the ADF. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, Stephen Smith may be responsible for war crimes. \n\nAnthony Albanese was a member of Cabinet at this time. Given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time, Albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them. However, over the period of ALP government 2007-13 he held a variety of roles (including Deputy PM under Rudd), and so it would be arguable when, where or whether he could be held responsible. Nonetheless he was a member of a government where the ADF was suspected to be committing war crimes, and the government rejected action on this.","sentiment_label":0}

If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O\u2019Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final \u201ccore skills occupations list\u201d.\n\n\u201cJobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Clare O\u2019Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.\n\nCoalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.\n\n\u201c\\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s\\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \\[Opposition Leader\\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council\u2019s State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government\u2019s target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.\n\nIn December, O\u2019Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but \u201cwe need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships\u201d.\n\nHowever, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.","sentiment_label":0}

The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.\n\nRenewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.\n\nThe only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and\/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.\n\nPreviously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.","sentiment_label":0}

That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.\n\nIn the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.\n\n[\n\nSo then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1\/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.\n\nThis only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2\/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.\n\nAt the moment, the \"green hydrogen\" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue.

{"id":"1d0ny0b","text":"Paywall\n\n The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector. It is not. It is a powerful, cashed-up lobby group promoting the interests of wind, water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in Australia.\n\nLast month, the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards, airport lounges and lifts in prime Sydney and Melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking Australia\u2019s future. It is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the Coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election.\n\nOpposition climate change and energy spokesman Ted O\u2019Brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix. Intermittent, disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid. Gas also would be a crucial part of the mix, principally because of its agility to ramp up or down, compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources.\n\nYet the renewables sector has bought none of it. It regards the election of a Coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight. Implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out. It would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt \u2013 not just temporarily, but for good,\u201d wrote Giles Parkinson, the editor of Renew Economy, the sector\u2019s equivalent of the China Daily.\n\nGiles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions, network capacity, connection delays, social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition.\n\nAt the end of the week, the announcement that the NSW government would pay Origin up to $225m to keep the Eraring Power Station operating for two years beyond its planned 2025 retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal. The Victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with EnergyAustralia, the owner of Yallourn, and AGL, which operates Loy Yong A. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system. The theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited.\n\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next 10 years, named somewhat optimistically as the Statement of Opportunities. AEMO said it had been advised of \u201cnumerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects\u201d, meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between 2025 and 2028.\n\nThis would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events, or blackouts as most people would call them. It gets worse. The new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate Bowen anticipated 18 months ago, and they need to get connected to the grid. Building 10,000km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected. Planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget.\n\nThere is no good news for Bowen or the sector in the AEMO report. Project EnergyConnect, the interconnection between NSW and South Australia, was regarded as the most straightforward high-voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory. Yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until July 2027 at the earliest. That will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the Torrens Island B and Osborne power stations shut. In NSW, delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected, and Victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission.\n\nEven if we accept AEMO\u2019s optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline, this is hardly the fast-track transition the government promised. In October 2022, Bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government\u2019s 82 per cent clean electricity target by 2030 would require the installation of 22,000 solar panels a day, 62 million in total, by the end of the decade. It would require a 7-megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every 18 hours, each as high as Crown\u2019s One Barangaroo tower in Sydney. About 10,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines would be needed to link up the vastly expanded network.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d5ngze","text":"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.\n\nTreasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry\u2019s services.\n\nPallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a \u201climited-term contract\u201d in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads\u2019 licensing and registration arms \u2013 a deal due to expire in the 2060s.\n\nThe industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was \u201choping to close any deal by the end of the year\u201d.\n\nA fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria\u2019s bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.\n\nA cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.\n\n\u201cIt can probably be done better,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThe senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.\n\nBirths, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.\n\nAsked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.\n\n\u201cVictoria\u2019s Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.\u201d\n\nThe government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.\n\nJust seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.\n\nThe same budget papers forecast Victoria\u2019s debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.\n\nLabor\u2019s primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.\n\nBut additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government\u2019s management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.\n\nLabor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.\n\nResearcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.\n\n\u201cDaniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cHe promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.\u201d\n\nJoyce said while Victoria\u2019s debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often \u201cshort-term gain for long-term pain\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security \u2013 cybersecurity in particular \u2013 could quite quickly run into trouble.\n\n\u201cIt would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.\u201d\n\nBirth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.\n\nThe total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services\u2019 most recent publicly available annual report.\n\nThe same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.\n\nIt took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.\n\nThe price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.\n\nDriver licensing and registration aren\u2019t the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.\n\nThe Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.\n\nLast year\u2019s housing statement also revealed Melbourne\u2019s public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.\n\nWhen VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.\n\n\u201cThis is not privatisation in anybody\u2019s language,\u201d the treasurer said at the time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.\u201d\n\nThe partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria\u2019s coffers.\n\nUnder the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.\n\nHowever, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency\u2019s licensing and registration for the next 40 years.","sentiment_label":0}

{"id":"1d4uh64","text":"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. \n\nI don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.\n\nI think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.\n\nThen again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. \n\nAs a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes [be]( [unneccesarily]( [specific]( however using the geographical centre of the seat (as the NSWEC does) leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.\n\nIf it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?\n\nAlso interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.","sentiment_label":0}
