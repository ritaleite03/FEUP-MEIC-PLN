These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.\n\n\n\nThe court proceedings detailed Mishra\u2019s actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.\n\n\n\nOn March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.\n\n\n\nMishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students\u2019 arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.","sentiment_label":0}

Russia is also friends with China, and china also own a few variants of sukhoi's, even the variants of su-30(su-30mki is the backbone of Indian Air force).\nInfact Chinese jets are half stolen US reverse engineered tech and the rest is russian. \n2. Rafale's are in a league of their own, a few years ago french forces, claimed to have won a dogfight with f-22 raptor in a friendly exercise.\n3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes\/ maintainance times than western jets and their engines.\n4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale)\n5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense\n6. Rafal's are launched by catapult whereas Russian aircrafts by ski jump. (Catapult is considered to be superior).\n7.

Indian Muslims are regularly expected to prove their patriotism because of this bullshit propoganda. \n\n>but that religion is fundamentally a flawed and barbaric one. I don't understand how people are defending it.\n\nEvery religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati. \n\n>any other scholars come out and speak against their agenda of converting the entire world to one religion\n\nAn ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu. \n\n>But when I knew what holy books of the top 2 religions are teaching, my respect for Hinduism only grew more. \n\nI can bet you have not read the holy books of the top two religions. \nChristianity teaches \"In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you\"\nIslam teaches \"None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.\"\n\nIf you're gonna do cherry picking and say that hinduism has good teachings and other religions have bad teachings, then you're just deluding yourself. All religions have good and bad teachings, people decide to follow different parts.","sentiment_label":0}

He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. \nHe was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep.

Some people (like your parents) are dead convinced that despite freedom of religion and absolute equality being enshrined in the Constitution Of India, despite it being drilled into everyone that all Indians are meant to be brothers and sisters, *some* Indians are more Indian than others simply because those \"other\" Indians had the audacity to be born into a different faith or a different caste - and that means they should be othered and pushed out of society and eventually out of the country. Merely because they're in the minority. To that end these fine upstanding most Indian of Indians will sink to any depths, make up any amount of bullshit to spread fear, lie, steal, and cheat their way into positions of power from which they can do their bidding and keep the masses distracted with this petty bullshit so they don't pay attention to the real issues holding the country back.\n\nClannishness begets clannishness. The minorities read the threat loud and clear, circle the wagons, protect their own, and thus begins an arms race that will never end until people like you make the effort to build bridges and stand up against inequality wherever you see it.

And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.\n\n\n3) Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges.

Shweta will attend cause she needs to validate that her daughter is doing something worthy of an award. Then they will reach out to small influencers, creators, maybe new entrepreneurs etc and ask them to pay some amount (its in lakhs) and they will giving them an award which will be presented by Shweta Bachhan or other celbrities they would've called in a similar manner. For small creators getting an award presented to them by some known person is a good photo op. So everyone wins and the organisers subtracting whatever they spend on venue and event organisation take the rest home.","sentiment_label":0}

It is not supposed to be one.\n\nEdit: Posting because the comment was deleted after i already typed the reply\n\n>Because most of the govt losses are due to inability and inefficiency of their business models not because of subsidies and general expenditures. If govt runs a business smoothly atleast from that business it should be close to break even point if not profitable. \n\n>Overall agar expenditure se thoda loss ho toh that\u2019s not an issue, but even general PSUs are making heavy losses. They are supposed to make profit or they\u2019ll be privatised soon enough.\n\nGovernment has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. \n\nThey could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such. Who will be the customers? The same people who paid taxes for building the highways in the first place. \n\nPeople are asking for free health care and education... Will that not create losses? But it is necessary because that is the government's responsibility to develop the country and its people.","sentiment_label":0}

Even though India was part of the non-aligned movement, being a socialist nation with a vast population living in poverty, we were always more attracted towards the USSR as opposed to the USA's mindless capitalism. This friendship stood the test of time through various arms and trade deals, even though Russia and India both look drastically different today than they did in the 1970s. In today's circumstances, India regrettably does not have the privilege to take a moral stand in the Ukraine conflict, even though most of us are opposed to it personally. 1.4 billion Indian people need Russian oil badly, without which the country would come to a standstill. Also, it's important to recognise that this is not Russia's war, it's Putin's war, and our country needs to stand by its ally regardless of their leader. This is not to say that India is happy with these events, we've made some pretty strong statements against the war. I understand that for the Nordic nations, your conflicts with Russia stretch back hundreds of years, but that's not the case with us.","sentiment_label":1}

{"id":"1d15ww8","text":"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.\n\nThe problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.\n\nThink about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?\n\nThe answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.\n\nNow, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.\n\nThe answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.\n\nWe have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.\n\nBut this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.\n\nAnd all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.\n\nSo both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and\/or stand against.","sentiment_label":1}
{"id":"1d3xqp9","text":"How is it exploitation if it creates work. I don\u2019t understand?\n\nThe delivery drivers are paid for the pickup too right? \nAlso the customers the people you accuse of exploiting aren\u2019t they themselves exploited too then? Someone here rightly pointed out that the consumer is also time bound and taking time off to go return a product, marks a half day for him which directly cut from their pockets.\n\nIf it\u2019s about low standards, harsh timelines, and other factors associated to a job then the whole of Indian is exploited isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve worked a corporate white collar job in a reputed service based company and I\u2019ve regularly crammed up 10am to 3am work schedule worked 7days a week with such tight deadlines that I\u2019ve skipped dinner at time. So many people Ik are on anti depressants because their work gives them bad intrusive thoughts.\n\nAlso if you decide to make your own returns, you in a way would take out from their job as less people would be needed in the market so for the same job? It\u2019s like saying t*s  should either up their mass entry package from 3.5 lpa to 6lpa or shouldn\u2019t hire at all. But if they actually decided to not hire, a large number of engineering grads would go jobless because t*s is a mass recruiter.","sentiment_label":0}

Perhaps even contact an NGO for potential abuse of the mentally handicapped.\n\n\nEdit: Going by your comment history (and I took screen grabs), you also appear to be a massive pervert.
